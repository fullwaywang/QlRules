    Sanitize 'move_pages()' permission checks
    
    The 'move_paghes()' system call was introduced long long ago with the
    same permission checks as for sending a signal (except using
    CAP_SYS_NICE instead of CAP_SYS_KILL for the overriding capability).
    
    That turns out to not be a great choice - while the system call really
    only moves physical page allocations around (and you need other
    capabilities to do a lot of it), you can check the return value to map
    out some the virtual address choices and defeat ASLR of a binary that
    still shares your uid.
    
    So change the access checks to the more common 'ptrace_may_access()'
    model instead.
    
    This tightens the access checks for the uid, and also effectively
    changes the CAP_SYS_NICE check to CAP_SYS_PTRACE, but it's unlikely that
    anybody really _uses_ this legacy system call any more (we hav ebetter
    NUMA placement models these days), so I expect nobody to notice.
    
    Famous last words.
