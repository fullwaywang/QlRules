    dm btree remove: assign new_root only when removal succeeds
    
    remove_raw() in dm_btree_remove() may fail due to IO read error
    (e.g. read the content of origin block fails during shadowing),
    and the value of shadow_spine::root is uninitialized, but
    the uninitialized value is still assign to new_root in the
    end of dm_btree_remove().
    
    For dm-thin, the value of pmd->details_root or pmd->root will become
    an uninitialized value, so if trying to read details_info tree again
    out-of-bound memory may occur as showed below:

    Fixing it by only assign new_root when removal succeeds
