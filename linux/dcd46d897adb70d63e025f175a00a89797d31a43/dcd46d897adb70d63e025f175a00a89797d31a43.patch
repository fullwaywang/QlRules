    exec: Force single empty string when argv is empty
    
    Quoting[1] Ariadne Conill:
    
    "In several other operating systems, it is a hard requirement that the
    second argument to execve(2) be the name of a program, thus prohibiting
    a scenario where argc < 1. POSIX 2017 also recommends this behaviour,
    but it is not an explicit requirement[2]:
    
        The argument arg0 should point to a filename string that is
        associated with the process being started by one of the exec
        functions.
    ...
    Interestingly, Michael Kerrisk opened an issue about this in 2008[3],
    but there was no consensus to support fixing this issue then.
    Hopefully now that CVE-2021-4034 shows practical exploitative use[4]
    of this bug in a shellcode, we can reconsider.
    
    This issue is being tracked in the KSPP issue tracker[5]."
    
    While the initial code searches[6][7] turned up what appeared to be
    mostly corner case tests, trying to that just reject argv == NULL
    (or an immediately terminated pointer list) quickly started tripping[8]
    existing userspace programs.
    
    The next best approach is forcing a single empty string into argv and
    adjusting argc to match. The number of programs depending on argc == 0
    seems a smaller set than those calling execve with a NULL argv.
    
    Account for the additional stack space in bprm_stack_limits(). Inject an
    empty string when argc == 0 (and set argc = 1). Warn about the case so
    userspace has some notice about the change:
    
        process './argc0' launched './argc0' with NULL argv: empty string added
    
    Additionally WARN() and reject NULL argv usage for kernel threads.
