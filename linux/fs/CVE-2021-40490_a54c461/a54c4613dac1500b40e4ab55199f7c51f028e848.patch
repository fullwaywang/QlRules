    ext4: fix race writing to an inline_data file while its xattrs are changing
    
    The location of the system.data extended attribute can change whenever
    xattr_sem is not taken.  So we need to recalculate the i_inline_off
    field since it mgiht have changed between ext4_write_begin() and
    ext4_write_end().
    
    This means that caching i_inline_off is probably not helpful, so in
    the long run we should probably get rid of it and shrink the in-memory
    ext4 inode slightly, but let's fix the race the simple way for now.
