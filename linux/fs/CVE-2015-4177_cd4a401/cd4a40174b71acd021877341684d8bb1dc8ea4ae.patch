    mnt: Fail collect_mounts when applied to unmounted mounts
    
    The only users of collect_mounts are in audit_tree.c
    
    In audit_trim_trees and audit_add_tree_rule the path passed into
    collect_mounts is generated from kern_path passed an audit_tree
    pathname which is guaranteed to be an absolute path.   In those cases
    collect_mounts is obviously intended to work on mounted paths and
    if a race results in paths that are unmounted when collect_mounts
    it is reasonable to fail early.
    
    The paths passed into audit_tag_tree don't have the absolute path
    check.  But are used to play with fsnotify and otherwise interact with
    the audit_trees, so again operating only on mounted paths appears
    reasonable.
    
    Avoid having to worry about what happens when we try and audit
    unmounted filesystems by restricting collect_mounts to mounts
    that appear in the mount tree.
