    atm: update msg_namelen in vcc_recvmsg()
    
    The current code does not fill the msg_name member in case it is set.
    It also does not set the msg_namelen member to 0 and therefore makes
    net/socket.c leak the local, uninitialized sockaddr_storage variable
    to userland -- 128 bytes of kernel stack memory.
    
    Fix that by simply setting msg_namelen to 0 as obviously nobody cared
    about vcc_recvmsg() not filling the msg_name in case it was set.
