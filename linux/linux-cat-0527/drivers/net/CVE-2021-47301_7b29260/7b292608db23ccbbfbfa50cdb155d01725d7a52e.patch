    igb: Fix use-after-free error during reset
    
    Cleans the next descriptor to watch (next_to_watch) when cleaning the
    TX ring.
    
    Failure to do so can cause invalid memory accesses. If igb_poll() runs
    while the controller is reset this can lead to the driver try to free
    a skb that was already freed.
    
    (The crash is harder to reproduce with the igb driver, but the same
    potential problem exists as the code is identical to igc)
