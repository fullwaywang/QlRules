    xen-blkback: set ring->xenblkd to NULL after kthread_stop()
    
    When xen_blkif_disconnect() is called, the kernel thread behind the
    block interface is stopped by calling kthread_stop(ring->xenblkd).
    The ring->xenblkd thread pointer being non-NULL determines if the
    thread has been already stopped.
    Normally, the thread's function xen_blkif_schedule() sets the
    ring->xenblkd to NULL, when the thread's main loop ends.
    
    However, when the thread has not been started yet (i.e.
    wake_up_process() has not been called on it), the xen_blkif_schedule()
    function would not be called yet.
    
    In such case the kthread_stop() call returns -EINTR and the
    ring->xenblkd remains dangling.
    When this happens, any consecutive call to xen_blkif_disconnect (for
    example in frontend_changed() callback) leads to a kernel crash in
    kthread_stop() (e.g. NULL pointer dereference in exit_creds()).
    
    This is XSA-350.
