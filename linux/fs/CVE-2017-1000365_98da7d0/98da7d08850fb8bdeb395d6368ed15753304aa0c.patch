    fs/exec.c: account for argv/envp pointers
    
    When limiting the argv/envp strings during exec to 1/4 of the stack limit,
    the storage of the pointers to the strings was not included.  This means
    that an exec with huge numbers of tiny strings could eat 1/4 of the stack
    limit in strings and then additional space would be later used by the
    pointers to the strings.
    
    For example, on 32-bit with a 8MB stack rlimit, an exec with 1677721
    single-byte strings would consume less than 2MB of stack, the max (8MB /
    4) amount allowed, but the pointers to the strings would consume the
    remaining additional stack space (1677721 * 4 == 6710884).
    
    The result (1677721 + 6710884 == 8388605) would exhaust stack space
    entirely.  Controlling this stack exhaustion could result in
    pathological behavior in setuid binaries (CVE-2017-1000365).
