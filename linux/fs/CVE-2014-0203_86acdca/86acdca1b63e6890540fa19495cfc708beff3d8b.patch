    fix autofs/afs/etc. magic mountpoint breakage
    
    We end up trying to kfree() nd.last.name on open("/mnt/tmp", O_CREAT)
    if /mnt/tmp is an autofs direct mount.  The reason is that nd.last_type
    is bogus here; we want LAST_BIND for everything of that kind and we
    get LAST_NORM left over from finding parent directory.
    
    So make sure that it *is* set properly; set to LAST_BIND before
    doing ->follow_link() - for normal symlinks it will be changed
    by __vfs_follow_link() and everything else needs it set that way.
