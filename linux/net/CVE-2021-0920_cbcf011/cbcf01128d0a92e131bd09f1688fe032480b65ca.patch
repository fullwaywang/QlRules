    af_unix: fix garbage collect vs MSG_PEEK
    
    unix_gc() assumes that candidate sockets can never gain an external
    reference (i.e.  be installed into an fd) while the unix_gc_lock is
    held.  Except for MSG_PEEK this is guaranteed by modifying inflight
    count under the unix_gc_lock.
    
    MSG_PEEK does not touch any variable protected by unix_gc_lock (file
    count is not), yet it needs to be serialized with garbage collection.
    Do this by locking/unlocking unix_gc_lock:
    
     1) increment file count
    
     2) lock/unlock barrier to make sure incremented file count is visible
        to garbage collection
    
     3) install file into fd
    
    This is a lock barrier (unlike smp_mb()) that ensures that garbage
    collection is run completely before or completely after the barrier.

+	 * MSG_PEEK is special in that it does not change the inflight count,
