    gfs2: Don't deref jdesc in evict
    
    On corrupt gfs2 file systems the evict code can try to reference the
    journal descriptor structure, jdesc, after it has been freed and set to
    NULL. The sequence of events is:
    
    init_journal()
    ...
    fail_jindex:
       gfs2_jindex_free(sdp); <------frees journals, sets jdesc = NULL
          if (gfs2_holder_initialized(&ji_gh))
             gfs2_glock_dq_uninit(&ji_gh);
    fail:
       iput(sdp->sd_jindex); <--references jdesc in evict_linked_inode
          evict()
             gfs2_evict_inode()
                evict_linked_inode()
                   ret = gfs2_trans_begin(sdp, 0, sdp->sd_jdesc->jd_blocks);
    <------references the now freed/zeroed sd_jdesc pointer.
    
    The call to gfs2_trans_begin is done because the truncate_inode_pages
    call can cause gfs2 events that require a transaction, such as removing
    journaled data (jdata) blocks from the journal.
    
    This patch fixes the problem by adding a check for sdp->sd_jdesc to
    function gfs2_evict_inode. In theory, this should only happen to corrupt
    gfs2 file systems, when gfs2 detects the problem, reports it, then tries
    to evict all the system inodes it has read in up to that point.
