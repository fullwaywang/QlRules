    Do not call http_hdr_flags() on pseudo-headers
    
    In http_EstimateWS(), all headers are passed to the http_isfiltered()
    function to calculate how many bytes is needed to serialize the entire
    struct http. http_isfiltered() will check the headers for whether they are
    going to be filtered out later and if so skip them.
    
    However http_isfiltered() would attempt to treat all elements of struct
    http as regular headers with an implicit structure. That does not hold for
    the first three pseudo-header entries, which would lead to asserts in
    later steps.
    
    This patch skips the filter step for pseudo-headers.
    
    Fixes: #3830
