    block: blk_init_allocated_queue() set q->fq as NULL in the fail case
    
    We find the memory use-after-free issue in __blk_drain_queue()
    on the kernel 4.14. After read the latest kernel 4.18-rc6 we
    think it has the same problem.
    
    Memory is allocated for q->fq in the blk_init_allocated_queue().
    If the elevator init function called with error return, it will
    run into the fail case to free the q->fq.
    
    Then the __blk_drain_queue() uses the same memory after the free
    of the q->fq, it will lead to the unpredictable event.
    
    The patch is to set q->fq as NULL in the fail case of
    blk_init_allocated_queue().
    
    Fixes: commit 7c94e1c157a2 ("block: introduce blk_flush_queue to drive flush machinery")
