    mm: add !pte_present() check on existing hugetlb_entry callbacks
    
    The age table walker doesn't check non-present hugetlb entry in common
    path, so hugetlb_entry() callbacks must check it.  The reason for this
    behavior is that some callers want to handle it in its own way.
    
    [ I think that reason is bogus, btw - it should just do what the regular
      code does, which is to call the "pte_hole()" function for such hugetlb
      entries  - Linus]
    
    However, some callers don't check it now, which causes unpredictable
    result, for example when we have a race between migrating hugepage and
    reading /proc/pid/numa_maps.  This patch fixes it by adding !pte_present
    checks on buggy callbacks.
    
    This bug exists for years and got visible by introducing hugepage
    migration.
    
    ChangeLog v2:
    - fix if condition (check !pte_present() instead of pte_present())
