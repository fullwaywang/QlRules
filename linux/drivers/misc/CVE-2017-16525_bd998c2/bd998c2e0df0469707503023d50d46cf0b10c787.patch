    USB: serial: console: fix use-after-free on disconnect
    
    A clean-up patch removing two redundant NULL-checks from the console
    disconnect handler inadvertently also removed a third check. This could
    lead to the struct usb_serial being prematurely freed by the console
    code when a driver accepts but does not register any ports for an
    interface which also lacks endpoint descriptors.
