commit f647d7c155f069c1a068030255c300663516420e

    x86_64, switch_to(): Load TLS descriptors before switching DS and ES
    
    Otherwise, if buggy user code points DS or ES into the TLS
    array, they would be corrupted after a context switch.
    
    This also significantly improves the comments and documents some
    gotchas in the code.
    
    Before this patch, the both tests below failed.  With this
    patch, the es test passes, although the gsbase test still fails.
