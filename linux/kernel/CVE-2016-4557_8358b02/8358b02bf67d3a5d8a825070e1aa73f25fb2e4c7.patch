    bpf: fix double-fdput in replace_map_fd_with_map_ptr()
    
    When bpf(BPF_PROG_LOAD, ...) was invoked with a BPF program whose bytecode
    references a non-map file descriptor as a map file descriptor, the error
    handling code called fdput() twice instead of once (in __bpf_map_get() and
    in replace_map_fd_with_map_ptr()). If the file descriptor table of the
    current task is shared, this causes f_count to be decremented too much,
    allowing the struct file to be freed while it is still in use
    (use-after-free). This can be exploited to gain root privileges by an
    unprivileged user.
    
    This bug was introduced in
    commit 0246e64d9a5f ("bpf: handle pseudo BPF_LD_IMM64 insn"), but is only
    exploitable since
    commit 1be7f75d1668 ("bpf: enable non-root eBPF programs") because
    previously, CAP_SYS_ADMIN was required to reach the vulnerable code.
