    mm: try_to_unmap_cluster() should lock_page() before mlocking
    
    A BUG_ON(!PageLocked) was triggered in mlock_vma_page() by Sasha Levin
    fuzzing with trinity.  The call site try_to_unmap_cluster() does not lock
    the pages other than its check_page parameter (which is already locked).
    
    The BUG_ON in mlock_vma_page() is not documented and its purpose is
    somewhat unclear, but apparently it serializes against page migration,
    which could otherwise fail to transfer the PG_mlocked flag.  This would
    not be fatal, as the page would be eventually encountered again, but
    NR_MLOCK accounting would become distorted nevertheless.  This patch adds
    a comment to the BUG_ON in mlock_vma_page() and munlock_vma_page() to that
    effect.
    
    The call site try_to_unmap_cluster() is fixed so that for page !=
    check_page, trylock_page() is attempted (to avoid possible deadlocks as we
    already have check_page locked) and mlock_vma_page() is performed only
    upon success.  If the page lock cannot be obtained, the page is left
    without PG_mlocked, which is again not a problem in the whole unevictable
    memory design.
