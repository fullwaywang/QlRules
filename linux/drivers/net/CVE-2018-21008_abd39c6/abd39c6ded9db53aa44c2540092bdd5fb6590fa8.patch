    rsi: add fix for crash during assertions
    
    Observed crash in some scenarios when assertion has occurred,
    this is because hw structure is freed and is tried to get
    accessed in some functions where null check is already
    present. So, avoided the crash by making the hw to NULL after
    freeing.
