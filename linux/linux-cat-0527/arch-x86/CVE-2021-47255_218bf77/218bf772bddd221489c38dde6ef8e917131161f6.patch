    kvm: LAPIC: Restore guard to prevent illegal APIC register access
    
    Per the SDM, "any access that touches bytes 4 through 15 of an APIC
    register may cause undefined behavior and must not be executed."
    Worse, such an access in kvm_lapic_reg_read can result in a leak of
    kernel stack contents. Prior to commit 01402cf81051 ("kvm: LAPIC:
    write down valid APIC registers"), such an access was explicitly
    disallowed. Restore the guard that was removed in that commit.
