    KVM: x86: fix for buffer overflow in handling of MSR_KVM_SYSTEM_TIME (CVE-2013-1796)
    
    If the guest sets the GPA of the time_page so that the request to update the
    time straddles a page then KVM will write onto an incorrect page.  The
    write is done byusing kmap atomic to get a pointer to the page for the time
    structure and then performing a memcpy to that page starting at an offset
    that the guest controls.  Well behaved guests always provide a 32-byte aligned
    address, however a malicious guest could use this to corrupt host kernel
    memory.
    
    Tested: Tested against kvmclock unit test.
