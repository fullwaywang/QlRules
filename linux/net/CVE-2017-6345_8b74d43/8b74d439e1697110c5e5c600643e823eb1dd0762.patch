    net/llc: avoid BUG_ON() in skb_orphan()
    
    It seems nobody used LLC since linux-3.12.
    
    Fortunately fuzzers like syzkaller still know how to run this code,
    otherwise it would be no fun.
    
    Setting skb->sk without skb->destructor leads to all kinds of
    bugs, we now prefer to be very strict about it.
    
    Ideally here we would use skb_set_owner() but this helper does not exist yet,
    only CAN seems to have a private helper for that.
