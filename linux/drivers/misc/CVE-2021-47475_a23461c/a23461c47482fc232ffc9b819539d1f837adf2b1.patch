    comedi: vmk80xx: fix transfer-buffer overflows
    
    The driver uses endpoint-sized USB transfer buffers but up until
    recently had no sanity checks on the sizes.
    
    Commit e1f13c879a7c ("staging: comedi: check validity of wMaxPacketSize
    of usb endpoints found") inadvertently fixed NULL-pointer dereferences
    when accessing the transfer buffers in case a malicious device has a
    zero wMaxPacketSize.
    
    Make sure to allocate buffers large enough to handle also the other
    accesses that are done without a size check (e.g. byte 18 in
    vmk80xx_cnt_insn_read() for the VMK8061_MODEL) to avoid writing beyond
    the buffers, for example, when doing descriptor fuzzing.
    
    The original driver was for a low-speed device with 8-byte buffers.
    Support was later added for a device that uses bulk transfers and is
    presumably a full-speed device with a maximum 64-byte wMaxPacketSize.
