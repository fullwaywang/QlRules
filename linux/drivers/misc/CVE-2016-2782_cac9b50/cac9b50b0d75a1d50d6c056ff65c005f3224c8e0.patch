    USB: visor: fix null-deref at probe
    
    Fix null-pointer dereference at probe should a (malicious) Treo device
    lack the expected endpoints.
    
    Specifically, the Treo port-setup hack was dereferencing the bulk-in and
    interrupt-in urbs without first making sure they had been allocated by
    core.
