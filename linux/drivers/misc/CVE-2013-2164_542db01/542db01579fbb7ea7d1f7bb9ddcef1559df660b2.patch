    drivers/cdrom/cdrom.c: use kzalloc() for failing hardware
    
    In drivers/cdrom/cdrom.c mmc_ioctl_cdrom_read_data() allocates a memory
    area with kmalloc in line 2885.
    
      2885         cgc->buffer = kmalloc(blocksize, GFP_KERNEL);
      2886         if (cgc->buffer == NULL)
      2887                 return -ENOMEM;
    
    In line 2908 we can find the copy_to_user function:
    
      2908         if (!ret && copy_to_user(arg, cgc->buffer, blocksize))
    
    The cgc->buffer is never cleaned and initialized before this function.
    If ret = 0 with the previous basic block, it's possible to display some
    memory bytes in kernel space from userspace.
    
    When we read a block from the disk it normally fills the ->buffer but if
    the drive is malfunctioning there is a chance that it would only be
    partially filled.  The result is an leak information to userspace.
