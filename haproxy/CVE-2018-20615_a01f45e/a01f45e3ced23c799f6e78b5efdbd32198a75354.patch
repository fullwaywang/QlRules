    BUG/CRITICAL: mux-h2: re-check the frame length when PRIORITY is used
    
    Tim DÃ¼sterhus reported a possible crash in the H2 HEADERS frame decoder
    when the PRIORITY flag is present. A check is missing to ensure the 5
    extra bytes needed with this flag are actually part of the frame. As per
    RFC7540#4.2, let's return a connection error with code FRAME_SIZE_ERROR.
    
    Many thanks to Tim for responsibly reporting this issue with a working
    config and reproducer. This issue was assigned CVE-2018-20615.
    
    This fix must be backported to 1.9 and 1.8.
