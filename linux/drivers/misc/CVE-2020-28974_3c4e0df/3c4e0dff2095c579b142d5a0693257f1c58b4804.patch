    It's buggy:

    Further there was only one user ever.
    - Android's loadfont, busybox and console-tools only ever use OP_GET
      and OP_SET
    - fbset documentation only mentions the kernel cmdline font: option,
      not anything else.
    - systemd used OP_COPY before release 232 published in Nov 2016
    
    Now unfortunately the crucial report seems to have gone down with
    gmane, and the commit message doesn't say much. But the pull request
    hints at OP_COPY being broken
    
    https://github.com/systemd/systemd/pull/3651
    
    So in other words, this never worked, and the only project which
    foolishly every tried to use it, realized that rather quickly too.
    
    Instead of trying to fix security issues here on dead code by adding
    missing checks, fix the entire thing by removing the functionality.
    
    Note that systemd code using the OP_COPY function ignored the return
    value, so it doesn't matter what we're doing here really - just in
    case a lone server somewhere happens to be extremely unlucky and
    running an affected old version of systemd. The relevant code from
    font_copy_to_all_vcs() in systemd was:
    
            /* copy font from active VT, where the font was uploaded to */
            cfo.op = KD_FONT_OP_COPY;
            cfo.height = vcs.v_active-1; /* tty1 == index 0 */
            (void) ioctl(vcfd, KDFONTOP, &cfo);
    
    Note this just disables the ioctl, garbage collecting the now unused
    callbacks is left for -next.
    
    v2: Tetsuo found the old mail, which allowed me to find it on another
    archive. Add the link too.
