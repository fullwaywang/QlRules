commit 6e629b5be45face20b4ca71c4fcbfed78b864a2e
Author: Matt Caswell <matt@openssl.org>
Date:   Tue Aug 23 00:01:57 2016 +0100

    Add some sanity checks when checking CRL scores
    
    Note: this was accidentally omitted from OpenSSL 1.0.2 branch.
    Without this fix any attempt to use CRLs will crash.
    
    CVE-2016-7052
    
    Thanks to Bruce Stephens and Thomas Jakobi for reporting this issue.
