    xfs: prevent leaking uninitialized stack memory in FSGEOMETRY_V1
    
    The FSGEOMETRY_V1 ioctl (and its compat equivalent) calls out to
    xfs_fs_geometry() with a version number of 3.  This code path does not
    fill in the logsunit member of the passed xfs_fsop_geom_t, leading to
    the leaking of four bytes of uninitialized stack data to potentially
    unprivileged callers.
    
    v2 switches to memset() to avoid future issues if structure members
    change, on suggestion of Dave Chinner.
