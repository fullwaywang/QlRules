    tracing: Have format file honor EVENT_FILE_FL_FREED
    
    commit b1560408692cd0ab0370cfbe9deb03ce97ab3f6d upstream.
    
    When eventfs was introduced, special care had to be done to coordinate the
    freeing of the file meta data with the files that are exposed to user
    space. The file meta data would have a ref count that is set when the file
    is created and would be decremented and freed after the last user that
    opened the file closed it. When the file meta data was to be freed, it
    would set a flag (EVENT_FILE_FL_FREED) to denote that the file is freed,
    and any new references made (like new opens or reads) would fail as it is
    marked freed. This allowed other meta data to be freed after this flag was
    set (under the event_mutex).
    
    All the files that were dynamically created in the events directory had a
    pointer to the file meta data and would call event_release() when the last
    reference to the user space file was closed. This would be the time that it
    is safe to free the file meta data.
    
    A shortcut was made for the "format" file. It's i_private would point to
    the "call" entry directly and not point to the file's meta data. This is
    because all format files are the same for the same "call", so it was
    thought there was no reason to differentiate them.  The other files
    maintain state (like the "enable", "trigger", etc). But this meant if the
    file were to disappear, the "format" file would be unaware of it.
    
    This caused a race that could be trigger via the user_events test (that
    would create dynamic events and free them), and running a loop that would
    read the user_events format files:
    
    In one console run:
    
     # cd tools/testing/selftests/user_events
     # while true; do ./ftrace_test; done
    
    And in another console run:
    
     # cd /sys/kernel/tracing/
     # while true; do cat events/user_events/__test_event/format; done 2>/dev/null
    
    With KASAN memory checking, it would trigger a use-after-free bug report
    (which was a real bug). This was because the format file was not checking
    the file's meta data flag "EVENT_FILE_FL_FREED", so it would access the
    event that the file meta data pointed to after the event was freed.
    
    After inspection, there are other locations that were found to not check
    the EVENT_FILE_FL_FREED flag when accessing the trace_event_file. Add a
    new helper function: event_file_file() that will make sure that the
    event_mutex is held, and will return NULL if the trace_event_file has the
    EVENT_FILE_FL_FREED flag set. Have the first reference of the struct file
    pointer use event_file_file() and check for NULL. Later uses can still use
    the event_file_data() helper function if the event_mutex is still held and
    was not released since the event_file_file() call.
