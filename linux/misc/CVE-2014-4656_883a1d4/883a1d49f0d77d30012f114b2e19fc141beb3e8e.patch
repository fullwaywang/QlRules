    ALSA: control: Make sure that id->index does not overflow
    
    The ALSA control code expects that the range of assigned indices to a control is
    continuous and does not overflow. Currently there are no checks to enforce this.
    If a control with a overflowing index range is created that control becomes
    effectively inaccessible and unremovable since snd_ctl_find_id() will not be
    able to find it. This patch adds a check that makes sure that controls with a
    overflowing index range can not be created.
