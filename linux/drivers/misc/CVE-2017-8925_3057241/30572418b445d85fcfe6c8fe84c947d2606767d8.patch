    USB: serial: omninet: fix reference leaks at open
    
    This driver needlessly took another reference to the tty on open, a
    reference which was then never released on close. This lead to not just
    a leak of the tty, but also a driver reference leak that prevented the
    driver from being unloaded after a port had once been opened.
