    agp: fix OOM and buffer overflow
    
    page_count is copied from userspace.  agp_allocate_memory() tries to
    check whether this number is too big, but doesn't take into account the
    wrap case.  Also agp_create_user_memory() doesn't check whether
    alloc_size is calculated from num_agp_pages variable without overflow.
    This may lead to allocation of too small buffer with following buffer
    overflow.
    
    Another problem in agp code is not addressed in the patch - kernel memory
    exhaustion (AGPIOC_RESERVE and AGPIOC_ALLOCATE ioctls).  It is not checked
    whether requested pid is a pid of the caller (no check in agpioc_reserve_wrap()).
    Each allocation is limited to 16KB, though, there is no per-process limit.
    This might lead to OOM situation, which is not even solved in case of the
    caller death by OOM killer - the memory is allocated for another (faked) process.
