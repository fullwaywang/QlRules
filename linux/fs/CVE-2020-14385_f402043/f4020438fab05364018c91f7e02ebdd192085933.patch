    xfs: fix boundary test in xfs_attr_shortform_verify
    
    The boundary test for the fixed-offset parts of xfs_attr_sf_entry in
    xfs_attr_shortform_verify is off by one, because the variable array
    at the end is defined as nameval[1] not nameval[].
    Hence we need to subtract 1 from the calculation.
    
    This can be shown by:
    
    # touch file
    # setfattr -n root.a file
    
    and verifications will fail when it's written to disk.
    
    This only matters for a last attribute which has a single-byte name
    and no value, otherwise the combination of namelen & valuelen will
    push endp further out and this test won't fail.
    
    Fixes: 1e1bbd8e7ee06 ("xfs: create structure verifier function for shortform xattrs")
