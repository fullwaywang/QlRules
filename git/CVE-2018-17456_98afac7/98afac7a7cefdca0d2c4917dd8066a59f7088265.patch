    submodule--helper: use "--" to signal end of clone options
    
    When we clone a submodule, we call "git clone $url $path".
    But there's nothing to say that those components can't begin
    with a dash themselves, confusing git-clone into thinking
    they're options. Let's pass "--" to make it clear what we
    expect.
    
    There's no test here, because it's actually quite hard to
    make these names work, even with "git clone" parsing them
    correctly. And we're going to restrict these cases even
    further in future commits. So we'll leave off testing until
    then; this is just the minimal fix to prevent us from doing
    something stupid with a badly formed entry.
