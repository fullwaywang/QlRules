    binfmt_elf: reintroduce using MAP_FIXED_NOREPLACE
    
    Commit b212921b13bd ("elf: don't use MAP_FIXED_NOREPLACE for elf
    executable mappings") reverted back to using MAP_FIXED to map ELF LOAD
    segments because it was found that the segments in some binaries overlap
    and can cause MAP_FIXED_NOREPLACE to fail.
    
    The original intent of MAP_FIXED_NOREPLACE in the ELF loader was to
    prevent the silent clobbering of an existing mapping (e.g.  stack) by
    the ELF image, which could lead to exploitable conditions.  Quoting
    commit 4ed28639519c ("fs, elf: drop MAP_FIXED usage from elf_map"),
    which originally introduced the use of MAP_FIXED_NOREPLACE in the
    loader:
    
        Both load_elf_interp and load_elf_binary rely on elf_map to map
        segments [to a specific] address and they use MAP_FIXED to enforce
        that. This is however [a] dangerous thing prone to silent data
        corruption which can be even exploitable.
        ...
        Let's take CVE-2017-1000253 as an example ... we could end up mapping
        [the executable] over the existing stack ... The [stack layout] issue
        has been fixed since then ... So we should be safe and any [similar]
        attack should be impractical. On the other hand this is just too
        subtle [an] assumption ... it can break quite easily and [be] hard to
        spot.
        ...
        Address this [weakness] by changing MAP_FIXED to the newly added
        MAP_FIXED_NOREPLACE. This will mean that mmap will fail if there is
        an existing mapping clashing with the requested one [instead of
        silently] clobbering it.
    
    Then processing ET_DYN binaries the loader already calculates a total
    size for the image when the first segment is mapped, maps the entire
    image, and then unmaps the remainder before the remaining segments are
    then individually mapped.
    
    To avoid the earlier problems (legitimate overlapping LOAD segments
    specified in the ELF), apply the same logic to ET_EXEC binaries as well.
    
    For both ET_EXEC and ET_DYN+INTERP use MAP_FIXED_NOREPLACE for the
    initial total size mapping and then use MAP_FIXED to build the final
    (possibly legitimately overlapping) mappings.  For ET_DYN w/out INTERP,
    continue to map at a system-selected address in the mmap region.
