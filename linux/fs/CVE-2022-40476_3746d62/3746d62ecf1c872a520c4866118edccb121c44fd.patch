    io_uring: use original request task for inflight tracking
    
    commit 386e4fb6962b9f248a80f8870aea0870ca603e89 upstream.
    
    In prior kernels, we did file assignment always at prep time. This meant
    that req->task == current. But after deferring that assignment and then
    pushing the inflight tracking back in, we've got the inflight tracking
    using current when it should in fact now be using req->task.
    
    Fixup that error introduced by adding the inflight tracking back after
    file assignments got modifed.
