    drm/v3d: Fix out-of-bounds read in `v3d_csd_job_run()`
    
    [ Upstream commit 497d370a644d95a9f04271aa92cb96d32e84c770 ]
    
    When enabling UBSAN on Raspberry Pi 5, we get the following warning:

    This happens because the UAPI provides only seven configuration
    registers and we are reading the eighth position of this u32 array.
    
    Therefore, fix the out-of-bounds read in `v3d_csd_job_run()` by
    accessing only seven positions on the '__u32 [7]' array. The eighth
    register exists indeed on V3D 7.1, but it isn't currently used. That
    being so, let's guarantee that it remains unused and add a note that it
    could be set in a future patch.
