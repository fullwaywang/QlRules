    mm/pagewalk.c: report holes in hugetlb ranges
    
    This matters at least for the mincore syscall, which will otherwise copy
    uninitialized memory from the page allocator to userspace.  It is
    probably also a correctness error for /proc/$pid/pagemap, but I haven't
    tested that.
    
    Removing the `walk->hugetlb_entry` condition in walk_hugetlb_range() has
    no effect because the caller already checks for that.
    
    This only reports holes in hugetlb ranges to callers who have specified
    a hugetlb_entry callback.
    
    This issue was found using an AFL-based fuzzer.
    
    v2:
     - don't crash on ->pte_hole==NULL (Andrew Morton)
     - add Cc stable (Andrew Morton)
