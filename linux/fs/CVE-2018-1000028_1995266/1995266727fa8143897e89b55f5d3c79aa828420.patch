    nfsd: auth: Fix gid sorting when rootsquash enabled
    
    Commit bdcf0a423ea1 ("kernel: make groups_sort calling a responsibility
    group_info allocators") appears to break nfsd rootsquash in a pretty
    major way.
    
    It adds a call to groups_sort() inside the loop that copies/squashes
    gids, which means the valid gids are sorted along with the following
    garbage.  The net result is that the highest numbered valid gids are
    replaced with any lower-valued garbage gids, possibly including 0.
    
    We should sort only once, after filling in all the gids.
