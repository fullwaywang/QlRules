    wait: add wake_up_pollfree()
    
    Several ->poll() implementations are special in that they use a
    waitqueue whose lifetime is the current task, rather than the struct
    file as is normally the case.  This is okay for blocking polls, since a
    blocking poll occurs within one task; however, non-blocking polls
    require another solution.  This solution is for the queue to be cleared
    before it is freed, using 'wake_up_poll(wq, EPOLLHUP | POLLFREE);'.
    
    However, that has a bug: wake_up_poll() calls __wake_up() with
    nr_exclusive=1.  Therefore, if there are multiple "exclusive" waiters,
    and the wakeup function for the first one returns a positive value, only
    that one will be called.  That's *not* what's needed for POLLFREE;
    POLLFREE is special in that it really needs to wake up everyone.
    
    Considering the three non-blocking poll systems:
    
    - io_uring poll doesn't handle POLLFREE at all, so it is broken anyway.
    
    - aio poll is unaffected, since it doesn't support exclusive waits.
      However, that's fragile, as someone could add this feature later.
    
    - epoll doesn't appear to be broken by this, since its wakeup function
      returns 0 when it sees POLLFREE.  But this is fragile.
    
    Although there is a workaround (see epoll), it's better to define a
    function which always sends POLLFREE to all waiters.  Add such a
    function.  Also make it verify that the queue really becomes empty after
    all waiters have been woken up.
