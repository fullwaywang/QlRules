    usb: iowarrior: don't trust report_size for buffer size
    
    If the iowarrior devices in this case statement support more than 8 bytes
    per report, it is possible to write past the end of a kernel heap allocation.
    This will probably never be possible, but change the allocation to be more
    defensive anyway.
