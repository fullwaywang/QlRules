    ext4: fix potential negative array index in do_split()
    
    If for any reason a directory passed to do_split() does not have enough
    active entries to exceed half the size of the block, we can end up
    iterating over all "count" entries without finding a split point.
    
    In this case, count == move, and split will be zero, and we will
    attempt a negative index into map[].
    
    Guard against this by detecting this case, and falling back to
    split-to-half-of-count instead; in this case we will still have
    plenty of space (> half blocksize) in each split block.
