    Fix Seg fault in DTLSv1_listen
    
    The DTLSv1_listen function is intended to be stateless and processes
    the initial ClientHello from many peers. It is common for user code to
    loop over the call to DTLSv1_listen until a valid ClientHello is received
    with an associated cookie. A defect in the implementation of DTLSv1_listen
    means that state is preserved in the SSL object from one invokation to the
    next that can lead to a segmentation fault. Erorrs processing the initial
    ClientHello can trigger this scenario. An example of such an error could
    be that a DTLS1.0 only client is attempting to connect to a DTLS1.2 only
    server.
