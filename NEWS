- 3/28/2023:
  Advance to better support C++.
  * Rules targetting Chromium V8 are added.
    - CVE and corresponding patches info are obtained from https://issues.chromium.org/
	- Though reverted commits have been discarded, it can be observed that there are
	  still many commits which were announced to be the very patches got reverted in
	  later development. As a result, rules corresponding to these commits will also
	  generate false positives in the latest codebase.
- 4/7/2023:
  Start using new QL predicates format, replace flat queries with hierarchical forms.
  * Rules targetting Chromium main project are added.
    - Partial CVEs starting from 2023 are included. Coverage is yet to be enhanced.
  * Hierarchical QL predicate format is used. This makes the queries more readable and
    less redundant.
	- This has been experimental for a while. For older versions of CodeQL (<=2.11.2)
	  hierarchical queries could take more time to execute in experiments, but with
	  the latest versions the problem has somehow gone.
