    nfsd4: readdirplus shouldn't return parent of export
    
    If you export a subdirectory of a filesystem, a READDIRPLUS on the root
    of that export will return the filehandle of the parent with the ".."
    entry.
    
    The filehandle is optional, so let's just not return the filehandle for
    ".." if we're at the root of an export.
    
    Note that once the client learns one filehandle outside of the export,
    they can trivially access the rest of the export using further lookups.
    
    However, it is also not very difficult to guess filehandles outside of
    the export.  So exporting a subdirectory of a filesystem should
    considered equivalent to providing access to the entire filesystem.  To
    avoid confusion, we recommend only exporting entire filesystems.
