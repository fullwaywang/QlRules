    net: avoid signed overflows for SO_{SND|RCV}BUFFORCE
    
    CAP_NET_ADMIN users should not be allowed to set negative
    sk_sndbuf or sk_rcvbuf values, as it can lead to various memory
    corruptions, crashes, OOM...
    
    Note that before commit 82981930125a ("net: cleanups in
    sock_setsockopt()"), the bug was even more serious, since SO_SNDBUF
    and SO_RCVBUF were vulnerable.
    
    This needs to be backported to all known linux kernels.
    
    Again, many thanks to syzkaller team for discovering this gem.
