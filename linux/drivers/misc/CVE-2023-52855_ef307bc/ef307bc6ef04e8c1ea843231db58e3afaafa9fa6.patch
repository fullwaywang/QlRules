    usb: dwc2: fix possible NULL pointer dereference caused by driver concurrency
    
    In _dwc2_hcd_urb_enqueue(), "urb->hcpriv = NULL" is executed without
    holding the lock "hsotg->lock". In _dwc2_hcd_urb_dequeue():
    
        spin_lock_irqsave(&hsotg->lock, flags);
        ...
            if (!urb->hcpriv) {
                    dev_dbg(hsotg->dev, "## urb->hcpriv is NULL ##\n");
                    goto out;
            }
        rc = dwc2_hcd_urb_dequeue(hsotg, urb->hcpriv); // Use urb->hcpriv
        ...
    out:
        spin_unlock_irqrestore(&hsotg->lock, flags);
    
    When _dwc2_hcd_urb_enqueue() and _dwc2_hcd_urb_dequeue() are
    concurrently executed, the NULL check of "urb->hcpriv" can be executed
    before "urb->hcpriv = NULL". After urb->hcpriv is NULL, it can be used
    in the function call to dwc2_hcd_urb_dequeue(), which can cause a NULL
    pointer dereference.
    
    This possible bug is found by an experimental static analysis tool
    developed by myself. This tool analyzes the locking APIs to extract
    function pairs that can be concurrently executed, and then analyzes the
    instructions in the paired functions to identify possible concurrency
    bugs including data races and atomicity violations. The above possible
    bug is reported, when my tool analyzes the source code of Linux 6.5.
    
    To fix this possible bug, "urb->hcpriv = NULL" should be executed with
    holding the lock "hsotg->lock". After using this patch, my tool never
    reports the possible bug, with the kernelconfiguration allyesconfig for
    x86_64. Because I have no associated hardware, I cannot test the patch
    in runtime testing, and just verify it according to the code logic.
