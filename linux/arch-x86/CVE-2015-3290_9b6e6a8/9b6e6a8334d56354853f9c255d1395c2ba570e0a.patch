    x86/nmi/64: Switch stacks on userspace NMI entry
    
    Returning to userspace is tricky: IRET can fail, and ESPFIX can
    rearrange the stack prior to IRET.
    
    The NMI nesting fixup relies on a precise stack layout and
    atomic IRET.  Rather than trying to teach the NMI nesting fixup
    to handle ESPFIX and failed IRET, punt: run NMIs that came from
    user mode on the normal kernel stack.
    
    This will make some nested NMIs visible to C code, but the C
    code is okay with that.
    
    As a side effect, this should speed up perf: it eliminates an
    RDMSR when NMIs come from user mode.
