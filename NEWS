- 3/28/2024:
  Advance to better support C++.
  * Rules targetting Chromium V8 are added.
    - CVE and corresponding patches info are obtained from https://issues.chromium.org/
	- Though reverted commits have been discarded, it can be observed that there are
	  still many commits which were announced to be the very patches got reverted in
	  later development. As a result, rules corresponding to these commits will also
	  generate false positives in the latest codebase.
- 4/7/2024:
  Start using new QL predicates format, replace flat queries with hierarchical forms.
  * Rules targetting Chromium main project are added.
    - Partial CVEs starting from 2023 are included. Coverage is yet to be enhanced.
  * Hierarchical QL predicate format is used. This makes the queries more readable and
    less redundant.
	- This has been experimental for a while. For older versions of CodeQL (<=2.11.2)
	  hierarchical queries could take more time to execute in experiments, but with
	  the latest versions the problem has somehow gone.
- 5/8/2024:
  Add rules for MySQL Server, whose CVEs have not been clearly disclosed.
  * The disclosed CVE info of MySQL Server and some other projects do not contain enough
    knowledge about the types, components and nature of the vulnerabilities. Thus we
	could only infer seemingly security-related bug-fixes in the git history according
	to commit comments, code patches, etc.
