    KEYS: potential uninitialized variable
    
    If __key_link_begin() failed then "edit" would be uninitialized.  I've
    added a check to fix that.
    
    This allows a random user to crash the kernel, though it's quite
    difficult to achieve.  There are three ways it can be done as the user
    would have to cause an error to occur in __key_link():
    
     (1) Cause the kernel to run out of memory.  In practice, this is difficult
         to achieve without ENOMEM cropping up elsewhere and aborting the
         attempt.
    
     (2) Revoke the destination keyring between the keyring ID being looked up
         and it being tested for revocation.  In practice, this is difficult to
         time correctly because the KEYCTL_REJECT function can only be used
         from the request-key upcall process.  Further, users can only make use
         of what's in /sbin/request-key.conf, though this does including a
         rejection debugging test - which means that the destination keyring
         has to be the caller's session keyring in practice.
    
     (3) Have just enough key quota available to create a key, a new session
         keyring for the upcall and a link in the session keyring, but not then
         sufficient quota to create a link in the nominated destination keyring
         so that it fails with EDQUOT.
    
    The bug can be triggered using option (3) above using something like the
    following:
    
    	echo 80 >/proc/sys/kernel/keys/root_maxbytes
    	keyctl request2 user debug:fred negate @t
    
    The above sets the quota to something much lower (80) to make the bug
    easier to trigger, but this is dependent on the system.  Note also that
    the name of the keyring created contains a random number that may be
    between 1 and 10 characters in size, so may throw the test off by
    changing the amount of quota used.
    
    Assuming the failure occurs, something like the following will be seen:
    
    	kfree_debugcheck: out of range ptr 6b6b6b6b6b6b6b68h
