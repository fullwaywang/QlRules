    mm: streamline COW logic in do_swap_page()
    
    Currently we have a different COW logic when:
    * triggering a read-fault to swapin first and then trigger a write-fault
      -> do_swap_page() + do_wp_page()
    * triggering a write-fault to swapin
      -> do_swap_page() + do_wp_page() only if we fail reuse in do_swap_page()
    
    The COW logic in do_swap_page() is different than our reuse logic in
    do_wp_page().  The COW logic in do_wp_page() -- page_count() == 1 -- makes
    currently sure that we certainly don't have a remaining reference, e.g.,
    via GUP, on the target page we want to reuse: if there is any unexpected
    reference, we have to copy to avoid information leaks.
    
    As do_swap_page() behaves differently, in environments with swap enabled
    we can currently have an unintended information leak from the parent to
    the child, similar as known from CVE-2020-29374:
    
            1. Parent writes to anonymous page
            -> Page is mapped writable and modified
            2. Page is swapped out
            -> Page is unmapped and replaced by swap entry
            3. fork()
            -> Swap entries are copied to child
            4. Child pins page R/O
            -> Page is mapped R/O into child
            5. Child unmaps page
            -> Child still holds GUP reference
            6. Parent writes to page
            -> Page is reused in do_swap_page()
            -> Child can observe changes
    
    Exchanging 2. and 3. should have the same effect.
    
    Let's apply the same COW logic as in do_wp_page(), conditionally trying to
    remove the page from the swapcache after freeing the swap entry, however,
    before actually mapping our page.  We can change the order now that we use
    try_to_free_swap(), which doesn't care about the mapcount, instead of
    reuse_swap_page().
    
    To handle references from the LRU pagevecs, conditionally drain the local
    LRU pagevecs when required, however, don't consider the page_count() when
    deciding whether to drain to keep it simple for now.
