    mm: remove gup_flags FOLL_WRITE games from __get_user_pages()
    
    This is an ancient bug that was actually attempted to be fixed once
    (badly) by me eleven years ago in commit 4ceb5db9757a ("Fix
    get_user_pages() race for write access") but that was then undone due to
    problems on s390 by commit f33ea7f404e5 ("fix get_user_pages bug").
    
    In the meantime, the s390 situation has long been fixed, and we can now
    fix it by checking the pte_dirty() bit properly (and do it better).  The
    s390 dirty bit was implemented in abf09bed3cce ("s390/mm: implement
    software dirty bits") which made it into v3.9.  Earlier kernels will
    have to look at the page state itself.
    
    Also, the VM has become more scalable, and what used a purely
    theoretical race back then has become easier to trigger.
    
    To fix it, we introduce a new internal FOLL_COW flag to mark the "yes,
    we already did a COW" rather than play racy games with FOLL_WRITE that
    is very fundamental, and then use the pte dirty flag to validate that
    the FOLL_COW flag is still valid.
