    media: uvcvideo: Fix 'type' check leading to overflow
    
    When initially testing the Camera Terminal Descriptor wTerminalType
    field (buffer[4]), no mask is used. Later in the function, the MSB is
    overloaded to store the descriptor subtype, and so a mask of 0x7fff
    is used to check the type.
    
    If a descriptor is specially crafted to set this overloaded bit in the
    original wTerminalType field, the initial type check will fail (falling
    through, without adjusting the buffer size), but the later type checks
    will pass, assuming the buffer has been made suitably large, causing an
    overflow.
    
    Avoid this problem by checking for the MSB in the wTerminalType field.
    If the bit is set, assume the descriptor is bad, and abort parsing it.
