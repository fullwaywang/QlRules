    KVM: x86: Fix potential divide by 0 in lapic (CVE-2013-6367)
    
    Under guest controllable circumstances apic_get_tmcct will execute a
    divide by zero and cause a crash.  If the guest cpuid support
    tsc deadline timers and performs the following sequence of requests
    the host will crash.
    - Set the mode to periodic
    - Set the TMICT to 0
    - Set the mode bits to 11 (neither periodic, nor one shot, nor tsc deadline)
    - Set the TMICT to non-zero.
    Then the lapic_timer.period will be 0, but the TMICT will not be.  If the
    guest then reads from the TMCCT then the host will perform a divide by 0.
    
    This patch ensures that if the lapic_timer.period is 0, then the division
    does not occur.
