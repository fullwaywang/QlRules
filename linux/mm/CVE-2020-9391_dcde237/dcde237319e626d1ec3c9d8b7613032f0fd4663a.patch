    mm: Avoid creating virtual address aliases in brk()/mmap()/mremap()
    
    Currently the arm64 kernel ignores the top address byte passed to brk(),
    mmap() and mremap(). When the user is not aware of the 56-bit address
    limit or relies on the kernel to return an error, untagging such
    pointers has the potential to create address aliases in user-space.
    Passing a tagged address to munmap(), madvise() is permitted since the
    tagged pointer is expected to be inside an existing mapping.
    
    The current behaviour breaks the existing glibc malloc() implementation
    which relies on brk() with an address beyond 56-bit to be rejected by
    the kernel.
    
    Remove untagging in the above functions by partially reverting commit
    ce18d171cb73 ("mm: untag user pointers in mmap/munmap/mremap/brk"). In
    addition, update the arm64 tagged-address-abi.rst document accordingly.
