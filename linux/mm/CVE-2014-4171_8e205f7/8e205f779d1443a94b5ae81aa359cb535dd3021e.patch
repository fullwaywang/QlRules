    shmem: fix faulting into a hole, not taking i_mutex
    
    Commit f00cdc6df7d7 ("shmem: fix faulting into a hole while it's
    punched") was buggy: Sasha sent a lockdep report to remind us that
    grabbing i_mutex in the fault path is a no-no (write syscall may already
    hold i_mutex while faulting user buffer).
    
    We tried a completely different approach (see following patch) but that
    proved inadequate: good enough for a rational workload, but not good
    enough against trinity - which forks off so many mappings of the object
    that contention on i_mmap_mutex while hole-puncher holds i_mutex builds
    into serious starvation when concurrent faults force the puncher to fall
    back to single-page unmap_mapping_range() searches of the i_mmap tree.
    
    So return to the original umbrella approach, but keep away from i_mutex
    this time.  We really don't want to bloat every shmem inode with a new
    mutex or completion, just to protect this unlikely case from trinity.
    So extend the original with wait_queue_head on stack at the hole-punch
    end, and wait_queue item on the stack at the fault end.
    
    This involves further use of i_lock to guard against the races: lockdep
    has been happy so far, and I see fs/inode.c:unlock_new_inode() holds
    i_lock around wake_up_bit(), which is comparable to what we do here.
    i_lock is more convenient, but we could switch to shmem's info->lock.
    
    This issue has been tagged with CVE-2014-4171, which will require commit
    f00cdc6df7d7 and this and the following patch to be backported: we
    suggest to 3.1+, though in fact the trinity forkbomb effect might go
    back as far as 2.6.16, when madvise(,,MADV_REMOVE) came in - or might
    not, since much has changed, with i_mmap_mutex a spinlock before 3.0.
    Anyone running trinity on 3.0 and earlier? I don't think we need care.
