    USB: yurex: Fix protection fault after device removal
    
    The syzkaller USB fuzzer found a general-protection-fault bug in the
    yurex driver.  The fault occurs when a device has been unplugged; the
    driver's interrupt-URB handler logs an error message referring to the
    device by name, after the device has been unregistered and its name
    deallocated.
    
    This problem is caused by the fact that the interrupt URB isn't
    cancelled until the driver's private data structure is released, which
    can happen long after the device is gone.  The cure is to make sure
    that the interrupt URB is killed before yurex_disconnect() returns;
    this is exactly the sort of thing that usb_poison_urb() was meant for.
