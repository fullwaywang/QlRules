    x86/speculation: Allow enabling STIBP with legacy IBRS
    
    When plain IBRS is enabled (not enhanced IBRS), the logic in
    spectre_v2_user_select_mitigation() determines that STIBP is not needed.
    
    The IBRS bit implicitly protects against cross-thread branch target
    injection. However, with legacy IBRS, the IBRS bit is cleared on
    returning to userspace for performance reasons which leaves userspace
    threads vulnerable to cross-thread branch target injection against which
    STIBP protects.
    
    Exclude IBRS from the spectre_v2_in_ibrs_mode() check to allow for
    enabling STIBP (through seccomp/prctl() by default or always-on, if
    selected by spectre_v2_user kernel cmdline parameter).
