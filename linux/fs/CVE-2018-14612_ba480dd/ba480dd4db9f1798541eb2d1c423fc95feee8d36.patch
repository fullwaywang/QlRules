    btrfs: tree-checker: Detect invalid and empty essential trees
    
    A crafted image has empty root tree block, which will later cause NULL
    pointer dereference.
    
    The following trees should never be empty:
    1) Tree root
       Must contain at least root items for extent tree, device tree and fs
       tree
    
    2) Chunk tree
       Or we can't even bootstrap as it contains the mapping.
    
    3) Fs tree
       At least inode item for top level inode (.).
    
    4) Device tree
       Dev extents for chunks
    
    5) Extent tree
       Must have corresponding extent for each chunk.
    
    If any of them is empty, we are sure the fs is corrupted and no need to
    mount it.
