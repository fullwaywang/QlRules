    cifs: fix NULL pointer dereference in cifs_find_smb_ses
    
    cifs_find_smb_ses assumes that the vol->password field is a valid
    pointer, but that's only the case if a password was passed in via
    the options string. It's possible that one won't be if there is
    no mount helper on the box.
