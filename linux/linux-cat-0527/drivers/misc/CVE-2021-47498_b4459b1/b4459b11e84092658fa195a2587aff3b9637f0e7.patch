    dm rq: don't queue request to blk-mq during DM suspend
    
    DM uses blk-mq's quiesce/unquiesce to stop/start device mapper queue.
    
    But blk-mq's unquiesce may come from outside events, such as elevator
    switch, updating nr_requests or others, and request may come during
    suspend, so simply ask for blk-mq to requeue it.
    
    Fixes one kernel panic issue when running updating nr_requests and
    dm-mpath suspend/resume stress test.
