    x86/mm: Add barriers and document switch_mm()-vs-flush synchronization
    
    When switch_mm() activates a new PGD, it also sets a bit that
    tells other CPUs that the PGD is in use so that TLB flush IPIs
    will be sent.  In order for that to work correctly, the bit
    needs to be visible prior to loading the PGD and therefore
    starting to fill the local TLB.
    
    Document all the barriers that make this work correctly and add
    a couple that were missing.
