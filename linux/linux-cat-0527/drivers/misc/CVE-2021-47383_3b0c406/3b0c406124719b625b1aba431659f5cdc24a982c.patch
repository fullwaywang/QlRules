    tty: Fix out-of-bound vmalloc access in imageblit
    
    This issue happens when a userspace program does an ioctl
    FBIOPUT_VSCREENINFO passing the fb_var_screeninfo struct
    containing only the fields xres, yres, and bits_per_pixel
    with values.
    
    If this struct is the same as the previous ioctl, the
    vc_resize() detects it and doesn't call the resize_screen(),
    leaving the fb_var_screeninfo incomplete. And this leads to
    the updatescrollmode() calculates a wrong value to
    fbcon_display->vrows, which makes the real_y() return a
    wrong value of y, and that value, eventually, causes
    the imageblit to access an out-of-bound address value.
    
    To solve this issue I made the resize_screen() be called
    even if the screen does not need any resizing, so it will
    "fix and fill" the fb_var_screeninfo independently.
