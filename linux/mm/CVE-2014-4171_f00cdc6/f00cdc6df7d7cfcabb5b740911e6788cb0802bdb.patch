    shmem: fix faulting into a hole while it's punched
    
    Trinity finds that mmap access to a hole while it's punched from shmem
    can prevent the madvise(MADV_REMOVE) or fallocate(FALLOC_FL_PUNCH_HOLE)
    from completing, until the reader chooses to stop; with the puncher's
    hold on i_mutex locking out all other writers until it can complete.
    
    It appears that the tmpfs fault path is too light in comparison with its
    hole-punching path, lacking an i_data_sem to obstruct it; but we don't
    want to slow down the common case.
    
    Extend shmem_fallocate()'s existing range notification mechanism, so
    shmem_fault() can refrain from faulting pages into the hole while it's
    punched, waiting instead on i_mutex (when safe to sleep; or repeatedly
    faulting when not).
