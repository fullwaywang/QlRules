    Pull locking fixes from Thomas Gleixner:
     "A set of PI futex fixes:
    
       - Address a longstanding issue where the user space part of the PI
         futex is not writeable. The kernel returns with inconsistent state
         which can in the worst case result in a UAF of a tasks kernel
         stack.
    
         The solution is to establish consistent kernel state which makes
         future operations on the futex fail because user space and kernel
         space state are inconsistent. Not a problem as PI futexes
         fundamentaly require a functional RW mapping and if user space
         pulls the rug under it, then it can keep the pieces it asked for.
    
       - Address an issue where the return value is incorrect in case that
         the futex was acquired after a timeout/signal made the waiter drop
         out of the rtmutex wait.
    
         In one of the corner cases the kernel returned an error code
         despite having successfully acquired the futex"

      futex: Handle faults correctly for PI futexes
      futex: Simplify fixup_pi_state_owner()
      futex: Use pi_state_update_owner() in put_pi_state()
      rtmutex: Remove unused argument from rt_mutex_proxy_unlock()
      futex: Provide and use pi_state_update_owner()
      futex: Replace pointless printk in fixup_owner()
      futex: Ensure the correct return value from futex_lock_pi()
