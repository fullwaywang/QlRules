    floppy: disable FDRAWCMD by default
    
    Minh Yuan reported a concurrency use-after-free issue in the floppy code
    between raw_cmd_ioctl and seek_interrupt.
    
    [ It turns out this has been around, and that others have reported the
      KASAN splats over the years, but Minh Yuan had a reproducer for it and
      so gets primary credit for reporting it for this fix   - Linus ]
    
    The problem is, this driver tends to break very easily and nowadays,
    nobody is expected to use FDRAWCMD anyway since it was used to
    manipulate non-standard formats.  The risk of breaking the driver is
    higher than the risk presented by this race, and accessing the device
    requires privileges anyway.
    
    Let's just add a config option to completely disable this ioctl and
    leave it disabled by default.  Distros shouldn't use it, and only those
    running on antique hardware might need to enable it.
