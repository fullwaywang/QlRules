    mnt: Move the test for MNT_LOCK_READONLY from change_mount_flags into do_remount
    
    There are no races as locked mount flags are guaranteed to never change.
    
    Moving the test into do_remount makes it more visible, and ensures all
    filesystem remounts pass the MNT_LOCK_READONLY permission check.  This
    second case is not an issue today as filesystem remounts are guarded
    by capable(CAP_DAC_ADMIN) and thus will always fail in less privileged
    mount namespaces, but it could become an issue in the future.
