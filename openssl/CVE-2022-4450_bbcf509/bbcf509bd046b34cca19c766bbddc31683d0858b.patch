    Avoid dangling ptrs in header and data params for PEM_read_bio_ex
    
    In the event of a failure in PEM_read_bio_ex() we free the buffers we
    allocated for the header and data buffers. However we were not clearing
    the ptrs stored in *header and *data. Since, on success, the caller is
    responsible for freeing these ptrs this can potentially lead to a double
    free if the caller frees them even on failure.
    
    Thanks to Dawei Wang for reporting this issue.
    
    Based on a proposed patch by Kurt Roeckx.
