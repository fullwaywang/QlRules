    igb: only use vlan_gro_receive if vlans are registered
    
    This change makes it so that vlan_gro_receive is only used if vlans have been
    registered to the adapter structure.  Previously we were just sending all vlan
    tagged frames in via this function but this results in a null pointer
    dereference when vlans are not registered.
