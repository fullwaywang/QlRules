    PCI: aardvark: Fix kernel panic during PIO transfer
    
    Trying to start a new PIO transfer by writing value 0 in PIO_START register
    when previous transfer has not yet completed (which is indicated by value 1
    in PIO_START) causes an External Abort on CPU, which results in kernel
    panic:
    
        SError Interrupt on CPU0, code 0xbf000002 -- SError
        Kernel panic - not syncing: Asynchronous SError Interrupt
    
    To prevent kernel panic, it is required to reject a new PIO transfer when
    previous one has not finished yet.
    
    If previous PIO transfer is not finished yet, the kernel may issue a new
    PIO request only if the previous PIO transfer timed out.
    
    In the past the root cause of this issue was incorrectly identified (as it
    often happens during link retraining or after link down event) and special
    hack was implemented in Trusted Firmware to catch all SError events in EL3,
    to ignore errors with code 0xbf000002 and not forwarding any other errors
    to kernel and instead throw panic from EL3 Trusted Firmware handler.

    https://review.trustedfirmware.org/c/TF-A/trusted-firmware-a/+/1541
    
    But the real cause was the fact that during link retraining or after link
    down event the PIO transfer may take longer time, up to the 1.44s until it
    times out. This increased probability that a new PIO transfer would be
    issued by kernel while previous one has not finished yet.
    
    After applying this change into the kernel, it is possible to revert the
    mentioned TF-A hack and SError events do not have to be caught in TF-A EL3.
