    tcp: avoid infinite loop in tcp_splice_read()
    
    Splicing from TCP socket is vulnerable when a packet with URG flag is
    received and stored into receive queue.
    
    __tcp_splice_read() returns 0, and sk_wait_data() immediately
    returns since there is the problematic skb in queue.
    
    This is a nice way to burn cpu (aka infinite loop) and trigger
    soft lockups.
    
    Again, this gem was found by syzkaller tool.
