    RDMA/cma: Fix crash in request handlers
    
    Doug Ledford and Red Hat reported a crash when running the rdma_cm on
    a real-time OS.  The crash has the following call trace:
    
        cm_process_work
           cma_req_handler
              cma_disable_callback
              rdma_create_id
                 kzalloc
                 init_completion
              cma_get_net_info
              cma_save_net_info
              cma_any_addr
                 cma_zero_addr
              rdma_translate_ip
                 rdma_copy_addr
              cma_acquire_dev
                 rdma_addr_get_sgid
                 ib_find_cached_gid
                 cma_attach_to_dev
              ucma_event_handler
                 kzalloc
                 ib_copy_ah_attr_to_user
              cma_comp

               copy_from_user
               _ucma_find_context
               ucma_put_ctx
               ucma_free_ctx
                  rdma_destroy_id
                     cma_exch
                     cma_cancel_operation
                     rdma_node_get_transport
    
            rt_mutex_slowunlock
            bad_area_nosemaphore
            oops_enter
    
    They were able to reproduce the crash multiple times with the
    following details:
    
        Crash seems to always happen on the:
                mutex_unlock(&conn_id->handler_mutex);
        as conn_id looks to have been freed during this code path.
    
    An examination of the code shows that a race exists in the request
    handlers.  When a new connection request is received, the rdma_cm
    allocates a new connection identifier.  This identifier has a single
    reference count on it.  If a user calls rdma_destroy_id() from another
    thread after receiving a callback, rdma_destroy_id will proceed to
    destroy the id and free the associated memory.  However, the request
    handlers may still be in the process of running.  When control returns
    to the request handlers, they can attempt to access the newly created
    identifiers.
    
    Fix this by holding a reference on the newly created rdma_cm_id until
    the request handler is through accessing it.
