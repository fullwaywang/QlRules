    x86/mm/32: Enable full randomization on i386 and X86_32
    
    Currently on i386 and on X86_64 when emulating X86_32 in legacy mode, only
    the stack and the executable are randomized but not other mmapped files
    (libraries, vDSO, etc.). This patch enables randomization for the
    libraries, vDSO and mmap requests on i386 and in X86_32 in legacy mode.
    
    By default on i386 there are 8 bits for the randomization of the libraries,
    vDSO and mmaps which only uses 1MB of VA.
    
    This patch preserves the original randomness, using 1MB of VA out of 3GB or
    4GB. We think that 1MB out of 3GB is not a big cost for having the ASLR.
    
    The first obvious security benefit is that all objects are randomized (not
    only the stack and the executable) in legacy mode which highly increases
    the ASLR effectiveness, otherwise the attackers may use these
    non-randomized areas. But also sensitive setuid/setgid applications are
    more secure because currently, attackers can disable the randomization of
    these applications by setting the ulimit stack to "unlimited". This is a
    very old and widely known trick to disable the ASLR in i386 which has been
    allowed for too long.
    
    Another trick used to disable the ASLR was to set the ADDR_NO_RANDOMIZE
    personality flag, but fortunately this doesn't work on setuid/setgid
    applications because there is security checks which clear Security-relevant
    flags.
    
    This patch always randomizes the mmap_legacy_base address, removing the
    possibility to disable the ASLR by setting the stack to "unlimited".
