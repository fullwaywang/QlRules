    kvm: x86: fix emulator buffer overflow (CVE-2014-0049)
    
    The problem occurs when the guest performs a pusha with the stack
    address pointing to an mmio address (or an invalid guest physical
    address) to start with, but then extending into an ordinary guest
    physical address.  When doing repeated emulated pushes
    emulator_read_write sets mmio_needed to 1 on the first one.  On a
    later push when the stack points to regular memory,
    mmio_nr_fragments is set to 0, but mmio_is_needed is not set to 0.
    
    As a result, KVM exits to userspace, and then returns to
    complete_emulated_mmio.  In complete_emulated_mmio
    vcpu->mmio_cur_fragment is incremented.  The termination condition of
    vcpu->mmio_cur_fragment == vcpu->mmio_nr_fragments is never achieved.
    The code bounces back and fourth to userspace incrementing
    mmio_cur_fragment past it's buffer.  If the guest does nothing else it
    eventually leads to a a crash on a memcpy from invalid memory address.
    
    However if a guest code can cause the vm to be destroyed in another
    vcpu with excellent timing, then kvm_clear_async_pf_completion_queue
    can be used by the guest to control the data that's pointed to by the
    call to cancel_work_item, which can be used to gain execution.
