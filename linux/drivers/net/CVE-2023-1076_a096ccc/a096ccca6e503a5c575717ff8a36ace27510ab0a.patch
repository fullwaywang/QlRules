    tun: tun_chr_open(): correctly initialize socket uid
    
    sock_init_data() assumes that the `struct socket` passed in input is
    contained in a `struct socket_alloc` allocated with sock_alloc().
    However, tun_chr_open() passes a `struct socket` embedded in a `struct
    tun_file` allocated with sk_alloc().
    This causes a type confusion when issuing a container_of() with
    SOCK_INODE() in sock_init_data() which results in assigning a wrong
    sk_uid to the `struct sock` in input.
    On default configuration, the type confused field overlaps with the
    high 4 bytes of `struct tun_struct __rcu *tun` of `struct tun_file`,
    NULL at the time of call, which makes the uid of all tun sockets 0,
    i.e., the root one.
    Fix the assignment by using sock_init_data_uid().
    
    Fixes: 86741ec25462 ("net: core: Add a UID field to struct sock.")
