    proc: prevent stacking filesystems on top
    
    This prevents stacking filesystems (ecryptfs and overlayfs) from using
    procfs as lower filesystem.  There is too much magic going on inside
    procfs, and there is no good reason to stack stuff on top of procfs.
    
    (For example, procfs does access checks in VFS open handlers, and
    ecryptfs by design calls open handlers from a kernel thread that doesn't
    drop privileges or so.)
