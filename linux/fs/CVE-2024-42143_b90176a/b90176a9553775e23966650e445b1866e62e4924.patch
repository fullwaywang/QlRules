    orangefs: fix out-of-bounds fsid access
    
    [ Upstream commit 53e4efa470d5fc6a96662d2d3322cfc925818517 ]
    
    Arnd Bergmann sent a patch to fsdevel, he says:
    
    "orangefs_statfs() copies two consecutive fields of the superblock into
    the statfs structure, which triggers a warning from the string fortification
    helpers"
    
    Jan Kara suggested an alternate way to do the patch to make it more readable.
    
    I ran both ideas through xfstests and both seem fine. This patch
    is based on Jan Kara's suggestion.
