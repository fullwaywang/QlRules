    ====================
    sctp: enhancements for the verification tag
    
    This patchset is to address CVE-2021-3772:
    
      A flaw was found in the Linux SCTP stack. A blind attacker may be able to
      kill an existing SCTP association through invalid chunks if the attacker
      knows the IP-addresses and port numbers being used and the attacker can
      send packets with spoofed IP addresses.
    
    This is caused by the missing VTAG verification for the received chunks
    and the incorrect vtag for the ABORT used to reply to these invalid
    chunks.
    
    This patchset is to go over all processing functions for the received
    chunks and do:
    
    1. Make sure sctp_vtag_verify() is called firstly to verify the vtag from
       the received chunk and discard this chunk if it fails. With some
       exceptions:
    
       a. sctp_sf_do_5_1B_init()/5_2_2_dupinit()/9_2_reshutack(), processing
          INIT chunk, as sctphdr vtag is always 0 in INIT chunk.
    
       b. sctp_sf_do_5_2_4_dupcook(), processing dupicate COOKIE_ECHO chunk,
          as the vtag verification will be done by sctp_tietags_compare() and
          then it takes right actions according to the return.
    
       c. sctp_sf_shut_8_4_5(), processing SHUTDOWN_ACK chunk for cookie_wait
          and cookie_echoed state, as RFC demand sending a SHUTDOWN_COMPLETE
          even if the vtag verification failed.
    
       d. sctp_sf_ootb(), called in many types of chunks for closed state or
          no asoc, as the same reason to c.
    
    2. Always use the vtag from the received INIT chunk to make the response
       ABORT in sctp_ootb_pkt_new().
    
    3. Fix the order for some checks and add some missing checks for the
       received chunk.
    
    This patch series has been tested with SCTP TAHI testing to make sure no
    regression caused on protocol conformance.
