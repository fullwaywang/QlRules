    bpf: Fix leakage due to insufficient speculative store bypass mitigation
    
    Spectre v4 gadgets make use of memory disambiguation, which is a set of
    techniques that execute memory access instructions, that is, loads and
    stores, out of program order; Intel's optimization manual, section 2.4.4.5:
    
      A load instruction micro-op may depend on a preceding store. Many
      microarchitectures block loads until all preceding store addresses are
      known. The memory disambiguator predicts which loads will not depend on
      any previous stores. When the disambiguator predicts that a load does
      not have such a dependency, the load takes its data from the L1 data
      cache. Eventually, the prediction is verified. If an actual conflict is
      detected, the load and all succeeding instructions are re-executed.
    
    af86ca4e3088 ("bpf: Prevent memory disambiguation attack") tried to mitigate
    this attack by sanitizing the memory locations through preemptive "fast"
    (low latency) stores of zero prior to the actual "slow" (high latency) store
    of a pointer value such that upon dependency misprediction the CPU then
    speculatively executes the load of the pointer value and retrieves the zero
    value instead of the attacker controlled scalar value previously stored at
    that location, meaning, subsequent access in the speculative domain is then
    redirected to the "zero page".
    
    The sanitized preemptive store of zero prior to the actual "slow" store is
    done through a simple ST instruction based on r10 (frame pointer) with
    relative offset to the stack location that the verifier has been tracking
    on the original used register for STX, which does not have to be r10. Thus,
    there are no memory dependencies for this store, since it's only using r10
    and immediate constant of zero; hence af86ca4e3088 /assumed/ a low latency
    operation.
    
    However, a recent attack demonstrated that this mitigation is not sufficient
    since the preemptive store of zero could also be turned into a "slow" store
    and is thus bypassed as well:
    
      [...]
      // r2 = oob address (e.g. scalar)
      // r7 = pointer to map value
      31: (7b) *(u64 *)(r10 -16) = r2
      // r9 will remain "fast" register, r10 will become "slow" register below
      32: (bf) r9 = r10
      // JIT maps BPF reg to x86 reg:
      //  r9  -> r15 (callee saved)
      //  r10 -> rbp
      // train store forward prediction to break dependency link between both r9
      // and r10 by evicting them from the predictor's LRU table.

      38: (63) *(u32 *)(r7 +29704) = r0
      39: (61) r0 = *(u32 *)(r7 +24588)

      545: (18) r1 = map[id:4]
      547: (bf) r2 = r7
      548: (b7) r3 = 0
      549: (b7) r4 = 4
      550: (85) call bpf_ringbuf_output#194288
      // instruction 551 inserted by verifier    \
      551: (7a) *(u64 *)(r10 -16) = 0            | /both/ are now slow stores here
      // storing map value pointer r7 at fp-16   | since value of r10 is "slow".
      552: (7b) *(u64 *)(r10 -16) = r7           /
      // following "fast" read to the same memory location, but due to dependency
      // misprediction it will speculatively execute before insn 551/552 completes.
      553: (79) r2 = *(u64 *)(r9 -16)
      // in speculative domain contains attacker controlled r2. in non-speculative
      // domain this contains r7, and thus accesses r7 +0 below.
      554: (71) r3 = *(u8 *)(r2 +0)
      // leak r3
    
    As can be seen, the current speculative store bypass mitigation which the
    verifier inserts at line 551 is insufficient since /both/, the write of
    the zero sanitation as well as the map value pointer are a high latency
    instruction due to prior memory access via push/pop of r10 (rbp) in contrast
    to the low latency read in line 553 as r9 (r15) which stays in hardware
    registers. Thus, architecturally, fp-16 is r7, however, microarchitecturally,
    fp-16 can still be r2.
    
    Initial thoughts to address this issue was to track spilled pointer loads
    from stack and enforce their load via LDX through r10 as well so that /both/
    the preemptive store of zero /as well as/ the load use the /same/ register
    such that a dependency is created between the store and load. However, this
    option is not sufficient either since it can be bypassed as well under
    speculation. An updated attack with pointer spill/fills now _all_ based on
    r10 would look as follows:
    
      [...]
      // r2 = oob address (e.g. scalar)
      // r7 = pointer to map value
      [...]
      // longer store forward prediction training sequence than before.

      2100: (7b) *(u64 *)(r10 -16) = r7        | since store unit is still busy.
      // load from stack intended to bypass stores.
      2101: (79) r2 = *(u64 *)(r10 -16)
      2102: (71) r3 = *(u8 *)(r2 +0)
      // leak r3
      [...]
    
    Looking at the CPU microarchitecture, the scheduler might issue loads (such
    as seen in line 2101) before stores (line 2099,2100) because the load execution
    units become available while the store execution unit is still busy with the
    sequence of dummy stores (line 2069-2098). And so the load may use the prior
    stored scalar from r2 at address r10 -16 for speculation. The updated attack
    may work less reliable on CPU microarchitectures where loads and stores share
    execution resources.
    
    This concludes that the sanitizing with zero stores from af86ca4e3088 ("bpf:
    Prevent memory disambiguation attack") is insufficient. Moreover, the detection
    of stack reuse from af86ca4e3088 where previously data (STACK_MISC) has been
    written to a given stack slot where a pointer value is now to be stored does
    not have sufficient coverage as precondition for the mitigation either; for
    several reasons outlined as follows:
    
     1) Stack content from prior program runs could still be preserved and is
        therefore not "random", best example is to split a speculative store
        bypass attack between tail calls, program A would prepare and store the
        oob address at a given stack slot and then tail call into program B which
        does the "slow" store of a pointer to the stack with subsequent "fast"
        read. From program B PoV such stack slot type is STACK_INVALID, and
        therefore also must be subject to mitigation.
    
     2) The STACK_SPILL must not be coupled to register_is_const(&stack->spilled_ptr)
        condition, for example, the previous content of that memory location could
        also be a pointer to map or map value. Without the fix, a speculative
        store bypass is not mitigated in such precondition and can then lead to
        a type confusion in the speculative domain leaking kernel memory near
        these pointer types.
    
    While brainstorming on various alternative mitigation possibilities, we also
    stumbled upon a retrospective from Chrome developers [0]:
    
      [...] For variant 4, we implemented a mitigation to zero the unused memory
      of the heap prior to allocation, which cost about 1% when done concurrently
      and 4% for scavenging. Variant 4 defeats everything we could think of. We
      explored more mitigations for variant 4 but the threat proved to be more
      pervasive and dangerous than we anticipated. For example, stack slots used
      by the register allocator in the optimizing compiler could be subject to
      type confusion, leading to pointer crafting. Mitigating type confusion for
      stack slots alone would have required a complete redesign of the backend of
      the optimizing compiler, perhaps man years of work, without a guarantee of
      completeness. [...]
    
    From BPF side, the problem space is reduced, however, options are rather
    limited. One idea that has been explored was to xor-obfuscate pointer spills
    to the BPF stack:
    
      [...]
      // preoccupy the CPU store port by running sequence of dummy stores.
      [...]
      2106: (63) *(u32 *)(r7 +29796) = r0
      2107: (63) *(u32 *)(r7 +29800) = r0
      2108: (63) *(u32 *)(r7 +29804) = r0
      2109: (63) *(u32 *)(r7 +29808) = r0
      2110: (63) *(u32 *)(r7 +29812) = r0
      // overwrite scalar with dummy pointer; xored with random 'secret' value
      // of 943576462 before store ...
      2111: (b4) w11 = 943576462
      2112: (af) r11 ^= r7
      2113: (7b) *(u64 *)(r10 -16) = r11
      2114: (79) r11 = *(u64 *)(r10 -16)
      2115: (b4) w2 = 943576462
      2116: (af) r2 ^= r11
      // ... and restored with the same 'secret' value with the help of AX reg.
      2117: (71) r3 = *(u8 *)(r2 +0)
      [...]
    
    While the above would not prevent speculation, it would make data leakage
    infeasible by directing it to random locations. In order to be effective
    and prevent type confusion under speculation, such random secret would have
    to be regenerated for each store. The additional complexity involved for a
    tracking mechanism that prevents jumps such that restoring spilled pointers
    would not get corrupted is not worth the gain for unprivileged. Hence, the
    fix in here eventually opted for emitting a non-public BPF_ST | BPF_NOSPEC
    instruction which the x86 JIT translates into a lfence opcode. Inserting the
    latter in between the store and load instruction is one of the mitigations
    options [1]. The x86 instruction manual notes:
    
      [...] An LFENCE that follows an instruction that stores to memory might
      complete before the data being stored have become globally visible. [...]
    
    The latter meaning that the preceding store instruction finished execution
    and the store is at minimum guaranteed to be in the CPU's store queue, but
    it's not guaranteed to be in that CPU's L1 cache at that point (globally
    visible). The latter would only be guaranteed via sfence. So the load which
    is guaranteed to execute after the lfence for that local CPU would have to
    rely on store-to-load forwarding. [2], in section 2.3 on store buffers says:
    
      [...] For every store operation that is added to the ROB, an entry is
      allocated in the store buffer. This entry requires both the virtual and
      physical address of the target. Only if there is no free entry in the store
      buffer, the frontend stalls until there is an empty slot available in the
      store buffer again. Otherwise, the CPU can immediately continue adding
      subsequent instructions to the ROB and execute them out of order. On Intel
      CPUs, the store buffer has up to 56 entries. [...]
    
    One small upside on the fix is that it lifts constraints from af86ca4e3088
    where the sanitize_stack_off relative to r10 must be the same when coming
    from different paths. The BPF_ST | BPF_NOSPEC gets emitted after a BPF_STX
    or BPF_ST instruction. This happens either when we store a pointer or data
    value to the BPF stack for the first time, or upon later pointer spills.
    The former needs to be enforced since otherwise stale stack data could be
    leaked under speculation as outlined earlier. For non-x86 JITs the BPF_ST |
    BPF_NOSPEC mapping is currently optimized away, but others could emit a
    speculation barrier as well if necessary. For real-world unprivileged
    programs e.g. generated by LLVM, pointer spill/fill is only generated upon
    register pressure and LLVM only tries to do that for pointers which are not
    used often. The program main impact will be the initial BPF_ST | BPF_NOSPEC
    sanitation for the STACK_INVALID case when the first write to a stack slot
    occurs e.g. upon map lookup. In future we might refine ways to mitigate
    the latter cost.
