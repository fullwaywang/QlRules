    sctp: fail if no bound addresses can be used for a given scope
    
    Currently, if you bind the socket to something like:
            servaddr.sin6_family = AF_INET6;
            servaddr.sin6_port = htons(0);
            servaddr.sin6_scope_id = 0;
            inet_pton(AF_INET6, "::1", &servaddr.sin6_addr);
    
    And then request a connect to:
            connaddr.sin6_family = AF_INET6;
            connaddr.sin6_port = htons(20000);
            connaddr.sin6_scope_id = if_nametoindex("lo");
            inet_pton(AF_INET6, "fe88::1", &connaddr.sin6_addr);
    
    What the stack does is:
     - bind the socket
     - create a new asoc
     - to handle the connect
       - copy the addresses that can be used for the given scope
       - try to connect
    
    But the copy returns 0 addresses, and the effect is that it ends up
    trying to connect as if the socket wasn't bound, which is not the
    desired behavior. This unexpected behavior also allows KASLR leaks
    through SCTP diag interface.
    
    The fix here then is, if when trying to copy the addresses that can
    be used for the scope used in connect() it returns 0 addresses, bail
    out. This is what TCP does with a similar reproducer.
