    staging: android: ashmem: fix a race condition in ASHMEM_SET_SIZE ioctl
    
    A lock-unlock is missing in ASHMEM_SET_SIZE ioctl which can result in a
    race condition when mmap is called. After the !asma->file check, before
    setting asma->size, asma->file can be set in mmap. That would result in
    having different asma->size than the mapped memory size. Combined with
    ASHMEM_UNPIN ioctl and shrinker invocation, this can result in memory
    corruption.
