    mnt: Change the default remount atime from relatime to the existing value
    
    Since March 2009 the kernel has treated the state that if no
    MS_..ATIME flags are passed then the kernel defaults to relatime.
    
    Defaulting to relatime instead of the existing atime state during a
    remount is silly, and causes problems in practice for people who don't
    specify any MS_...ATIME flags and to get the default filesystem atime
    setting.  Those users may encounter a permission error because the
    default atime setting does not work.
    
    A default that does not work and causes permission problems is
    ridiculous, so preserve the existing value to have a default
    atime setting that is always guaranteed to work.
    
    Using the default atime setting in this way is particularly
    interesting for applications built to run in restricted userspace
    environments without /proc mounted, as the existing atime mount
    options of a filesystem can not be read from /proc/mounts.
    
    In practice this fixes user space that uses the default atime
    setting on remount that are broken by the permission checks
    keeping less privileged users from changing more privileged users
    atime settings.
