    Fix up non-directory creation in SGID directories
    
    sgid directories have special semantics, making newly created files in
    the directory belong to the group of the directory, and newly created
    subdirectories will also become sgid.  This is historically used for
    group-shared directories.
    
    But group directories writable by non-group members should not imply
    that such non-group members can magically join the group, so make sure
    to clear the sgid bit on non-directories for non-members (but remember
    that sgid without group execute means "mandatory locking", just to
    confuse things even more).
