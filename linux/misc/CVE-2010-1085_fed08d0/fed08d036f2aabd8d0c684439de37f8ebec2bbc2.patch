    ALSA: hda-intel: Avoid divide by zero crash
    
    On my AMD780V chipset, hda_intel.c can crash the kernel with a divide by
    zero
    for as-yet unknown reasons. A simple check for zero prevents it, though
    the problem that causes it remains. Since the workaround is harmless and
    won't affect anyone except victims of this bug, it should be safe;
    moreover,
    because this crash can be triggered by a user-mode application, there are
    denial of service implications on the systems affected by the bug without
    the patch.
