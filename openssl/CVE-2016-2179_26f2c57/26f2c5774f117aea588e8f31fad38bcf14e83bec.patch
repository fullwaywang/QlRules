    Fix DTLS buffered message DoS attack
    
    DTLS can handle out of order record delivery. Additionally since
    handshake messages can be bigger than will fit into a single packet, the
    messages can be fragmented across multiple records (as with normal TLS).
    That means that the messages can arrive mixed up, and we have to
    reassemble them. We keep a queue of buffered messages that are "from the
    future", i.e. messages we're not ready to deal with yet but have arrived
    early. The messages held there may not be full yet - they could be one
    or more fragments that are still in the process of being reassembled.
    
    The code assumes that we will eventually complete the reassembly and
    when that occurs the complete message is removed from the queue at the
    point that we need to use it.
    
    However, DTLS is also tolerant of packet loss. To get around that DTLS
    messages can be retransmitted. If we receive a full (non-fragmented)
    message from the peer after previously having received a fragment of
    that message, then we ignore the message in the queue and just use the
    non-fragmented version. At that point the queued message will never get
    removed.
    
    Additionally the peer could send "future" messages that we never get to
    in order to complete the handshake. Each message has a sequence number
    (starting from 0). We will accept a message fragment for the current
    message sequence number, or for any sequence up to 10 into the future.
    However if the Finished message has a sequence number of 2, anything
    greater than that in the queue is just left there.
    
    So, in those two ways we can end up with "orphaned" data in the queue
    that will never get removed - except when the connection is closed. At
    that point all the queues are flushed.
    
    An attacker could seek to exploit this by filling up the queues with
    lots of large messages that are never going to be used in order to
    attempt a DoS by memory exhaustion.
    
    I will assume that we are only concerned with servers here. It does not
    seem reasonable to be concerned about a memory exhaustion attack on a
    client. They are unlikely to process enough connections for this to be
    an issue.
    
    A "long" handshake with many messages might be 5 messages long (in the
    incoming direction), e.g. ClientHello, Certificate, ClientKeyExchange,
    CertificateVerify, Finished. So this would be message sequence numbers 0
    to 4. Additionally we can buffer up to 10 messages in the future.
    Therefore the maximum number of messages that an attacker could send
    that could get orphaned would typically be 15.
    
    The maximum size that a DTLS message is allowed to be is defined by
    max_cert_list, which by default is 100k. Therefore the maximum amount of
    "orphaned" memory per connection is 1500k.
    
    Message sequence numbers get reset after the Finished message, so
    renegotiation will not extend the maximum number of messages that can be
    orphaned per connection.
    
    As noted above, the queues do get cleared when the connection is closed.
    Therefore in order to mount an effective attack, an attacker would have
    to open many simultaneous connections.
