    net: sctp: fix sctp_sf_do_5_1D_ce to verify if we/peer is AUTH capable
    
    RFC4895 introduced AUTH chunks for SCTP; during the SCTP
    handshake RANDOM; CHUNKS; HMAC-ALGO are negotiated (CHUNKS
    being optional though):
    
      ---------- INIT[RANDOM; CHUNKS; HMAC-ALGO] ---------->
      <------- INIT-ACK[RANDOM; CHUNKS; HMAC-ALGO] ---------
      -------------------- COOKIE-ECHO -------------------->
      <-------------------- COOKIE-ACK ---------------------
    
    A special case is when an endpoint requires COOKIE-ECHO
    chunks to be authenticated:
    
      ---------- INIT[RANDOM; CHUNKS; HMAC-ALGO] ---------->
      <------- INIT-ACK[RANDOM; CHUNKS; HMAC-ALGO] ---------
      ------------------ AUTH; COOKIE-ECHO ---------------->
      <-------------------- COOKIE-ACK ---------------------
    
    RFC4895, section 6.3. Receiving Authenticated Chunks says:
    
      The receiver MUST use the HMAC algorithm indicated in
      the HMAC Identifier field. If this algorithm was not
      specified by the receiver in the HMAC-ALGO parameter in
      the INIT or INIT-ACK chunk during association setup, the
      AUTH chunk and all the chunks after it MUST be discarded
      and an ERROR chunk SHOULD be sent with the error cause
      defined in Section 4.1. [...] If no endpoint pair shared
      key has been configured for that Shared Key Identifier,
      all authenticated chunks MUST be silently discarded. [...]
    
      When an endpoint requires COOKIE-ECHO chunks to be
      authenticated, some special procedures have to be followed
      because the reception of a COOKIE-ECHO chunk might result
      in the creation of an SCTP association. If a packet arrives
      containing an AUTH chunk as a first chunk, a COOKIE-ECHO
      chunk as the second chunk, and possibly more chunks after
      them, and the receiver does not have an STCB for that
      packet, then authentication is based on the contents of
      the COOKIE-ECHO chunk. In this situation, the receiver MUST
      authenticate the chunks in the packet by using the RANDOM
      parameters, CHUNKS parameters and HMAC_ALGO parameters
      obtained from the COOKIE-ECHO chunk, and possibly a local
      shared secret as inputs to the authentication procedure
      specified in Section 6.3. If authentication fails, then
      the packet is discarded. If the authentication is successful,
      the COOKIE-ECHO and all the chunks after the COOKIE-ECHO
      MUST be processed. If the receiver has an STCB, it MUST
      process the AUTH chunk as described above using the STCB
      from the existing association to authenticate the
      COOKIE-ECHO chunk and all the chunks after it. [...]
    
    Commit bbd0d59809f9 introduced the possibility to receive
    and verification of AUTH chunk, including the edge case for
    authenticated COOKIE-ECHO. On reception of COOKIE-ECHO,
    the function sctp_sf_do_5_1D_ce() handles processing,
    unpacks and creates a new association if it passed sanity
    checks and also tests for authentication chunks being
    present. After a new association has been processed, it
    invokes sctp_process_init() on the new association and
    walks through the parameter list it received from the INIT
    chunk. It checks SCTP_PARAM_RANDOM, SCTP_PARAM_HMAC_ALGO
    and SCTP_PARAM_CHUNKS, and copies them into asoc->peer
    meta data (peer_random, peer_hmacs, peer_chunks) in case
    sysctl -w net.sctp.auth_enable=1 is set. If in INIT's
    SCTP_PARAM_SUPPORTED_EXT parameter SCTP_CID_AUTH is set,
    peer_random != NULL and peer_hmacs != NULL the peer is to be
    assumed asoc->peer.auth_capable=1, in any other case
    asoc->peer.auth_capable=0.
    
    Now, if in sctp_sf_do_5_1D_ce() chunk->auth_chunk is
    available, we set up a fake auth chunk and pass that on to
    sctp_sf_authenticate(), which at latest in
    sctp_auth_calculate_hmac() reliably dereferences a NULL pointer
    at position 0..0008 when setting up the crypto key in
    crypto_hash_setkey() by using asoc->asoc_shared_key that is
    NULL as condition key_id == asoc->active_key_id is true if
    the AUTH chunk was injected correctly from remote. This
    happens no matter what net.sctp.auth_enable sysctl says.
    
    The fix is to check for net->sctp.auth_enable and for
    asoc->peer.auth_capable before doing any operations like
    sctp_sf_authenticate() as no key is activated in
    sctp_auth_asoc_init_active_key() for each case.
    
    Now as RFC4895 section 6.3 states that if the used HMAC-ALGO
    passed from the INIT chunk was not used in the AUTH chunk, we
    SHOULD send an error; however in this case it would be better
    to just silently discard such a maliciously prepared handshake
    as we didn't even receive a parameter at all. Also, as our
    endpoint has no shared key configured, section 6.3 says that
    MUST silently discard, which we are doing from now onwards.
    
    Before calling sctp_sf_pdiscard(), we need not only to free
    the association, but also the chunk->auth_chunk skb, as
    commit bbd0d59809f9 created a skb clone in that case.
    
    I have tested this locally by using netfilter's nfqueue and
    re-injecting packets into the local stack after maliciously
    modifying the INIT chunk (removing RANDOM; HMAC-ALGO param)
    and the SCTP packet containing the COOKIE_ECHO (injecting
    AUTH chunk before COOKIE_ECHO). Fixed with this patch applied.
