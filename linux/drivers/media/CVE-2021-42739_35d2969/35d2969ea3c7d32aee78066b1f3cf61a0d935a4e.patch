    media: firewire: firedtv-avc: fix a buffer overflow in avc_ca_pmt()
    
    The bounds checking in avc_ca_pmt() is not strict enough.  It should
    be checking "read_pos + 4" because it's reading 5 bytes.  If the
    "es_info_length" is non-zero then it reads a 6th byte so there needs to
    be an additional check for that.
    
    I also added checks for the "write_pos".  I don't think these are
    required because "read_pos" and "write_pos" are tied together so
    checking one ought to be enough.  But they make the code easier to
    understand for me.  The check on write_pos is:
    
            if (write_pos + 4 >= sizeof(c->operand) - 4) {
    
    The first "+ 4" is because we're writing 5 bytes and the last " - 4"
    is to leave space for the CRC.
    
    The other problem is that "length" can be invalid.  It comes from
    "data_length" in fdtv_ca_pmt().
