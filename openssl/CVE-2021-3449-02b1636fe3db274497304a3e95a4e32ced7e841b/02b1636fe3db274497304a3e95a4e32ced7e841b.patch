    ssl sigalg extension: fix NULL pointer dereference
    
    As the variable peer_sigalgslen is not cleared on ssl rehandshake, it's
    possible to crash an openssl tls secured server remotely by sending a
    manipulated hello message in a rehandshake.
    
    On such a manipulated rehandshake, tls1_set_shared_sigalgs() calls
    tls12_shared_sigalgs() with the peer_sigalgslen of the previous
    handshake, while the peer_sigalgs has been freed.
    As a result tls12_shared_sigalgs() walks over the available
    peer_sigalgs and tries to access data of a NULL pointer.
    
    This issue was introduced by c589c34e61 (Add support for the TLS 1.3
    signature_algorithms_cert extension, 2018-01-11).
