    mm: memcg: Correct unregistring of events attached to the same eventfd
    
    There is an issue when memcg unregisters events that were attached to
    the same eventfd:
    
    - On the first call mem_cgroup_usage_unregister_event() removes all
      events attached to a given eventfd, and if there were no events left,
      thresholds->primary would become NULL;
    
    - Since there were several events registered, cgroups core will call
      mem_cgroup_usage_unregister_event() again, but now kernel will oops,
      as the function doesn't expect that threshold->primary may be NULL.
    
    That's a good question whether mem_cgroup_usage_unregister_event()
    should actually remove all events in one go, but nowadays it can't
    do any better as cftype->unregister_event callback doesn't pass
    any private event-associated cookie. So, let's fix the issue by
    simply checking for threshold->primary.
    
    FWIW, w/o the patch the following oops may be observed:
