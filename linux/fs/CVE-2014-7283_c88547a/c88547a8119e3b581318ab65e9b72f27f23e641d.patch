    xfs: fix directory hash ordering bug
    
    Commit f5ea1100 ("xfs: add CRCs to dir2/da node blocks") introduced
    in 3.10 incorrectly converted the btree hash index array pointer in
    xfs_da3_fixhashpath(). It resulted in the the current hash always
    being compared against the first entry in the btree rather than the
    current block index into the btree block's hash entry array. As a
    result, it was comparing the wrong hashes, and so could misorder the
    entries in the btree.
    
    For most cases, this doesn't cause any problems as it requires hash
    collisions to expose the ordering problem. However, when there are
    hash collisions within a directory there is a very good probability
    that the entries will be ordered incorrectly and that actually
    matters when duplicate hashes are placed into or removed from the
    btree block hash entry array.
    
    This bug results in an on-disk directory corruption and that results
    in directory verifier functions throwing corruption warnings into
    the logs. While no data or directory entries are lost, access to
    them may be compromised, and attempts to remove entries from a
    directory that has suffered from this corruption may result in a
    filesystem shutdown.  xfs_repair will fix the directory hash
    ordering without data loss occuring.
