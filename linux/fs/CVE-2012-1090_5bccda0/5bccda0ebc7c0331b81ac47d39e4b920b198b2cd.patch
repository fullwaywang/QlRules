    cifs: fix dentry refcount leak when opening a FIFO on lookup
    
    The cifs code will attempt to open files on lookup under certain
    circumstances. What happens though if we find that the file we opened
    was actually a FIFO or other special file?
    
    Currently, the open filehandle just ends up being leaked leading to
    a dentry refcount mismatch and oops on umount. Fix this by having the
    code close the filehandle on the server if it turns out not to be a
    regular file. While we're at it, change this spaghetti if statement
    into a switch too.
