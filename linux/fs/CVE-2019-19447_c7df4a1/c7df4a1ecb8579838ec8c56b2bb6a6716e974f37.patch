    ext4: work around deleting a file with i_nlink == 0 safely
    
    If the file system is corrupted such that a file's i_links_count is
    too small, then it's possible that when unlinking that file, i_nlink
    will already be zero.  Previously we were working around this kind of
    corruption by forcing i_nlink to one; but we were doing this before
    trying to delete the directory entry --- and if the file system is
    corrupted enough that ext4_delete_entry() fails, then we exit with
    i_nlink elevated, and this causes the orphan inode list handling to be
    FUBAR'ed, such that when we unmount the file system, the orphan inode
    list can get corrupted.
    
    A better way to fix this is to simply skip trying to call drop_nlink()
    if i_nlink is already zero, thus moving the check to the place where
    it makes the most sense.
