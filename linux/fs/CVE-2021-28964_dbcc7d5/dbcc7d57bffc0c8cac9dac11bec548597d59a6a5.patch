    btrfs: fix race when cloning extent buffer during rewind of an old root
    
    While resolving backreferences, as part of a logical ino ioctl call or
    fiemap, we can end up hitting a BUG_ON() when replaying tree mod log
    operations of a root, triggering a stack trace like the following:

      1208                    switch (tm->op) {
      1209                    case MOD_LOG_KEY_REMOVE_WHILE_FREEING:
      1210                            BUG_ON(tm->slot < n);
      1211                            fallthrough;
      1212                    case MOD_LOG_KEY_REMOVE_WHILE_MOVING:
      1213                    case MOD_LOG_KEY_REMOVE:
      1214                            btrfs_set_node_key(eb, &tm->key, tm->slot);
    
    Here's what happens to hit that BUG_ON():
    
    1) We have one tree mod log user (through fiemap or the logical ino ioctl),
       with a sequence number of 1, so we have fs_info->tree_mod_seq == 1;
    
    2) Another task is at ctree.c:balance_level() and we have eb X currently as
       the root of the tree, and we promote its single child, eb Y, as the new
       root.
    
       Then, at ctree.c:balance_level(), we call:
    
          tree_mod_log_insert_root(eb X, eb Y, 1);
    
    3) At tree_mod_log_insert_root() we create tree mod log elements for each
       slot of eb X, of operation type MOD_LOG_KEY_REMOVE_WHILE_FREEING each
       with a ->logical pointing to ebX->start. These are placed in an array
       named tm_list.
       Lets assume there are N elements (N pointers in eb X);
    
    4) Then, still at tree_mod_log_insert_root(), we create a tree mod log
       element of operation type MOD_LOG_ROOT_REPLACE, ->logical set to
       ebY->start, ->old_root.logical set to ebX->start, ->old_root.level set
       to the level of eb X and ->generation set to the generation of eb X;
    
    5) Then tree_mod_log_insert_root() calls tree_mod_log_free_eb() with
       tm_list as argument. After that, tree_mod_log_free_eb() calls
       __tree_mod_log_insert() for each member of tm_list in reverse order,
       from highest slot in eb X, slot N - 1, to slot 0 of eb X;
    
    6) __tree_mod_log_insert() sets the sequence number of each given tree mod
       log operation - it increments fs_info->tree_mod_seq and sets
       fs_info->tree_mod_seq as the sequence number of the given tree mod log
       operation.
    
       This means that for the tm_list created at tree_mod_log_insert_root(),
       the element corresponding to slot 0 of eb X has the highest sequence
       number (1 + N), and the element corresponding to the last slot has the
       lowest sequence number (2);
    
    7) Then, after inserting tm_list's elements into the tree mod log rbtree,
       the MOD_LOG_ROOT_REPLACE element is inserted, which gets the highest
       sequence number, which is N + 2;
    
    8) Back to ctree.c:balance_level(), we free eb X by calling
       btrfs_free_tree_block() on it. Because eb X was created in the current
       transaction, has no other references and writeback did not happen for
       it, we add it back to the free space cache/tree;
    
    9) Later some other task T allocates the metadata extent from eb X, since
       it is marked as free space in the space cache/tree, and uses it as a
       node for some other btree;
    
    10) The tree mod log user task calls btrfs_search_old_slot(), which calls
        get_old_root(), and finally that calls __tree_mod_log_oldest_root()
        with time_seq == 1 and eb_root == eb Y;
    
    11) First iteration of the while loop finds the tree mod log element with
        sequence number N + 2, for the logical address of eb Y and of type
        MOD_LOG_ROOT_REPLACE;
    
    12) Because the operation type is MOD_LOG_ROOT_REPLACE, we don't break out
        of the loop, and set root_logical to point to tm->old_root.logical
        which corresponds to the logical address of eb X;
    
    13) On the next iteration of the while loop, the call to
        tree_mod_log_search_oldest() returns the smallest tree mod log element
        for the logical address of eb X, which has a sequence number of 2, an
        operation type of MOD_LOG_KEY_REMOVE_WHILE_FREEING and corresponds to
        the old slot N - 1 of eb X (eb X had N items in it before being freed);
    
    14) We then break out of the while loop and return the tree mod log operation
        of type MOD_LOG_ROOT_REPLACE (eb Y), and not the one for slot N - 1 of
        eb X, to get_old_root();
    
    15) At get_old_root(), we process the MOD_LOG_ROOT_REPLACE operation
        and set "logical" to the logical address of eb X, which was the old
        root. We then call tree_mod_log_search() passing it the logical
        address of eb X and time_seq == 1;
    
    16) Then before calling tree_mod_log_search(), task T adds a key to eb X,
        which results in adding a tree mod log operation of type
        MOD_LOG_KEY_ADD to the tree mod log - this is done at
        ctree.c:insert_ptr() - but after adding the tree mod log operation
        and before updating the number of items in eb X from 0 to 1...
    
    17) The task at get_old_root() calls tree_mod_log_search() and gets the
        tree mod log operation of type MOD_LOG_KEY_ADD just added by task T.
        Then it enters the following if branch:
    
        if (old_root && tm && tm->op != MOD_LOG_KEY_REMOVE_WHILE_FREEING) {
           (...)
        } (...)
    
        Calls read_tree_block() for eb X, which gets a reference on eb X but
        does not lock it - task T has it locked.
        Then it clones eb X while it has nritems set to 0 in its header, before
        task T sets nritems to 1 in eb X's header. From hereupon we use the
        clone of eb X which no other task has access to;
    
    18) Then we call __tree_mod_log_rewind(), passing it the MOD_LOG_KEY_ADD
        mod log operation we just got from tree_mod_log_search() in the
        previous step and the cloned version of eb X;
    
    19) At __tree_mod_log_rewind(), we set the local variable "n" to the number
        of items set in eb X's clone, which is 0. Then we enter the while loop,
        and in its first iteration we process the MOD_LOG_KEY_ADD operation,
        which just decrements "n" from 0 to (u32)-1, since "n" is declared with
        a type of u32. At the end of this iteration we call rb_next() to find the
        next tree mod log operation for eb X, that gives us the mod log operation
        of type MOD_LOG_KEY_REMOVE_WHILE_FREEING, for slot 0, with a sequence
        number of N + 1 (steps 3 to 6);
    
    20) Then we go back to the top of the while loop and trigger the following
        BUG_ON():
    
            (...)
            switch (tm->op) {
            case MOD_LOG_KEY_REMOVE_WHILE_FREEING:
                     BUG_ON(tm->slot < n);
                     fallthrough;
            (...)
    
        Because "n" has a value of (u32)-1 (4294967295) and tm->slot is 0.
    
    Fix this by taking a read lock on the extent buffer before cloning it at
    ctree.c:get_old_root(). This should be done regardless of the extent
    buffer having been freed and reused, as a concurrent task might be
    modifying it (while holding a write lock on it).
