    io_uring: fix UAF due to missing POLLFREE handling
    
    Fixes a problem described in 50252e4b5e989
    ("aio: fix use-after-free due to missing POLLFREE handling")
    and copies the approach used there.
    
    In short, we have to forcibly eject a poll entry when we meet POLLFREE.
    We can't rely on io_poll_get_ownership() as can't wait for potentially
    running tw handlers, so we use the fact that wqs are RCU freed. See
    Eric's patch and comments for more details.
