    perf/x86/intel: Fix a crash caused by zero PEBS status
    
    A repeatable crash can be triggered by the perf_fuzzer on some Haswell
    system.

    For some old CPUs (HSW and earlier), the PEBS status in a PEBS record
    may be mistakenly set to 0. To minimize the impact of the defect, the
    commit was introduced to try to avoid dropping the PEBS record for some
    cases. It adds a check in the intel_pmu_drain_pebs_nhm(), and updates
    the local pebs_status accordingly. However, it doesn't correct the PEBS
    status in the PEBS record, which may trigger the crash, especially for
    the large PEBS.
    
    It's possible that all the PEBS records in a large PEBS have the PEBS
    status 0. If so, the first get_next_pebs_record_by_bit() in the
    __intel_pmu_pebs_event() returns NULL. The at = NULL. Since it's a large
    PEBS, the 'count' parameter must > 1. The second
    get_next_pebs_record_by_bit() will crash.
    
    Besides the local pebs_status, correct the PEBS status in the PEBS
    record as well.
