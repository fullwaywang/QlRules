    btrfs: skip reserved bytes warning on unmount after log cleanup failure
    
    commit 40cdc509877bacb438213b83c7541c5e24a1d9ec upstream.
    
    After the recent changes made by commit c2e39305299f01 ("btrfs: clear
    extent buffer uptodate when we fail to write it") and its followup fix,
    commit 651740a5024117 ("btrfs: check WRITE_ERR when trying to read an
    extent buffer"), we can now end up not cleaning up space reservations of
    log tree extent buffers after a transaction abort happens, as well as not
    cleaning up still dirty extent buffers.
    
    This happens because if writeback for a log tree extent buffer failed,
    then we have cleared the bit EXTENT_BUFFER_UPTODATE from the extent buffer
    and we have also set the bit EXTENT_BUFFER_WRITE_ERR on it. Later on,
    when trying to free the log tree with free_log_tree(), which iterates
    over the tree, we can end up getting an -EIO error when trying to read
    a node or a leaf, since read_extent_buffer_pages() returns -EIO if an
    extent buffer does not have EXTENT_BUFFER_UPTODATE set and has the
    EXTENT_BUFFER_WRITE_ERR bit set. Getting that -EIO means that we return
    immediately as we can not iterate over the entire tree.
    
    In that case we never update the reserved space for an extent buffer in
    the respective block group and space_info object.
    
    When this happens we get the following traces when unmounting the fs:

    This also means that in case we have log tree extent buffers that are
    still dirty, we can end up not cleaning them up in case we find an
    extent buffer with EXTENT_BUFFER_WRITE_ERR set on it, as in that case
    we have no way for iterating over the rest of the tree.
    
    This issue is very often triggered with test cases generic/475 and
    generic/648 from fstests.
    
    The issue could almost be fixed by iterating over the io tree attached to
    each log root which keeps tracks of the range of allocated extent buffers,
    log_root->dirty_log_pages, however that does not work and has some
    inconveniences:
    
    1) After we sync the log, we clear the range of the extent buffers from
       the io tree, so we can't find them after writeback. We could keep the
       ranges in the io tree, with a separate bit to signal they represent
       extent buffers already written, but that means we need to hold into
       more memory until the transaction commits.
    
       How much more memory is used depends a lot on whether we are able to
       allocate contiguous extent buffers on disk (and how often) for a log
       tree - if we are able to, then a single extent state record can
       represent multiple extent buffers, otherwise we need multiple extent
       state record structures to track each extent buffer.
       In fact, my earlier approach did that:
    
       https://lore.kernel.org/linux-btrfs/3aae7c6728257c7ce2279d6660ee2797e5e34bbd.1641300250.git.fdmanana@suse.com/
    
       However that can cause a very significant negative impact on
       performance, not only due to the extra memory usage but also because
       we get a larger and deeper dirty_log_pages io tree.
       We got a report that, on beefy machines at least, we can get such
       performance drop with fsmark for example:
    
       https://lore.kernel.org/linux-btrfs/20220117082426.GE32491@xsang-OptiPlex-9020/
    
    2) We would be doing it only to deal with an unexpected and exceptional
       case, which is basically failure to read an extent buffer from disk
       due to IO failures. On a healthy system we don't expect transaction
       aborts to happen after all;
    
    3) Instead of relying on iterating the log tree or tracking the ranges
       of extent buffers in the dirty_log_pages io tree, using the radix
       tree that tracks extent buffers (fs_info->buffer_radix) to find all
       log tree extent buffers is not reliable either, because after writeback
       of an extent buffer it can be evicted from memory by the release page
       callback of the btree inode (btree_releasepage()).
    
    Since there's no way to be able to properly cleanup a log tree without
    being able to read its extent buffers from disk and without using more
    memory to track the logical ranges of the allocated extent buffers do
    the following:
    
    1) When we fail to cleanup a log tree, setup a flag that indicates that
       failure;
    
    2) Trigger writeback of all log tree extent buffers that are still dirty,
       and wait for the writeback to complete. This is just to cleanup their
       state, page states, page leaks, etc;
    
    3) When unmounting the fs, ignore if the number of bytes reserved in a
       block group and in a space_info is not 0 if, and only if, we failed to
       cleanup a log tree. Also ignore only for metadata block groups and the
       metadata space_info object.
    
    This is far from a perfect solution, but it serves to silence test
    failures such as those from generic/475 and generic/648. However having
    a non-zero value for the reserved bytes counters on unmount after a
    transaction abort, is not such a terrible thing and it's completely
    harmless, it does not affect the filesystem integrity in any way.
