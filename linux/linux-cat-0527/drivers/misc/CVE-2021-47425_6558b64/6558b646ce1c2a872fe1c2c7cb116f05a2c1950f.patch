    i2c: acpi: fix resource leak in reconfiguration device addition
    
    acpi_i2c_find_adapter_by_handle() calls bus_find_device() which takes a
    reference on the adapter which is never released which will result in a
    reference count leak and render the adapter unremovable.  Make sure to
    put the adapter after creating the client in the same manner that we do
    for OF.
