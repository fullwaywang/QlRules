    Fix return code for truncated DTLS fragment.
    
    Previously, a truncated DTLS fragment in
    |dtls1_process_out_of_seq_message| would cause *ok to be cleared, but
    the return value would still be the number of bytes read. This would
    cause |dtls1_get_message| not to consider it an error and it would
    continue processing as normal until the calling function noticed that
    *ok was zero.
    
    I can't see an exploit here because |dtls1_get_message| uses
    |s->init_num| as the length, which will always be zero from what I can
    see.
