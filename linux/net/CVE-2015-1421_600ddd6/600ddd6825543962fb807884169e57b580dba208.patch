    net: sctp: fix slab corruption from use after free on INIT collisions
    
    When hitting an INIT collision case during the 4WHS with AUTH enabled, as
    already described in detail in commit 1be9a950c646 ("net: sctp: inherit
    auth_capable on INIT collisions"), it can happen that we occasionally
    still remotely trigger the following panic on server side which seems to
    have been uncovered after the fix from commit 1be9a950c646 ...

    With slab debugging enabled, we can see that the poison has been overwritten:

    Since this only triggers in some collision-cases with AUTH, the problem at
    heart is that sctp_auth_key_put() on asoc->asoc_shared_key is called twice
    when having refcnt 1, once directly in sctp_assoc_update() and yet again
    from within sctp_auth_asoc_init_active_key() via sctp_assoc_update() on
    the already kzfree'd memory, which is also consistent with the observation
    of the poison decrease from 0x6b to 0x6a (note: the overwrite is detected
    at a later point in time when poison is checked on new allocation).
    
    Reference counting of auth keys revisited:
    
    Shared keys for AUTH chunks are being stored in endpoints and associations
    in endpoint_shared_keys list. On endpoint creation, a null key is being
    added; on association creation, all endpoint shared keys are being cached
    and thus cloned over to the association. struct sctp_shared_key only holds
    a pointer to the actual key bytes, that is, struct sctp_auth_bytes which
    keeps track of users internally through refcounting. Naturally, on assoc
    or enpoint destruction, sctp_shared_key are being destroyed directly and
    the reference on sctp_auth_bytes dropped.
    
    User space can add keys to either list via setsockopt(2) through struct
    sctp_authkey and by passing that to sctp_auth_set_key() which replaces or
    adds a new auth key. There, sctp_auth_create_key() creates a new sctp_auth_bytes
    with refcount 1 and in case of replacement drops the reference on the old
    sctp_auth_bytes. A key can be set active from user space through setsockopt()
    on the id via sctp_auth_set_active_key(), which iterates through either
    endpoint_shared_keys and in case of an assoc, invokes (one of various places)
    sctp_auth_asoc_init_active_key().
    
    sctp_auth_asoc_init_active_key() computes the actual secret from local's
    and peer's random, hmac and shared key parameters and returns a new key
    directly as sctp_auth_bytes, that is asoc->asoc_shared_key, plus drops
    the reference if there was a previous one. The secret, which where we
    eventually double drop the ref comes from sctp_auth_asoc_set_secret() with
    intitial refcount of 1, which also stays unchanged eventually in
    sctp_assoc_update(). This key is later being used for crypto layer to
    set the key for the hash in crypto_hash_setkey() from sctp_auth_calculate_hmac().
    
    To close the loop: asoc->asoc_shared_key is freshly allocated secret
    material and independant of the sctp_shared_key management keeping track
    of only shared keys in endpoints and assocs. Hence, also commit 4184b2a79a76
    ("net: sctp: fix memory leak in auth key management") is independant of
    this bug here since it concerns a different layer (though same structures
    being used eventually). asoc->asoc_shared_key is reference dropped correctly
    on assoc destruction in sctp_association_free() and when active keys are
    being replaced in sctp_auth_asoc_init_active_key(), it always has a refcount
    of 1. Hence, it's freed prematurely in sctp_assoc_update(). Simple fix is
    to remove that sctp_auth_key_put() from there which fixes these panics.
