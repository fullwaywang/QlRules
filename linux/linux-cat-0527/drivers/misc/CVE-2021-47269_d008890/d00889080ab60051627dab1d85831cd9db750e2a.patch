    usb: dwc3: ep0: fix NULL pointer exception
    
    There is no validation of the index from dwc3_wIndex_to_dep() and we might
    be referring a non-existing ep and trigger a NULL pointer exception. In
    certain configurations we might use fewer eps and the index might wrongly
    indicate a larger ep index than existing.
    
    By adding this validation from the patch we can actually report a wrong
    index back to the caller.
    
    In our usecase we are using a composite device on an older kernel, but
    upstream might use this fix also. Unfortunately, I cannot describe the
    hardware for others to reproduce the issue as it is a proprietary
    implementation.
