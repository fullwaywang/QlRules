    btrfs: make sure that WRITTEN is set on all metadata blocks
    
    We previously would call btrfs_check_leaf() if we had the check
    integrity code enabled, which meant that we could only run the extended
    leaf checks if we had WRITTEN set on the header flags.
    
    This leaves a gap in our checking, because we could end up with
    corruption on disk where WRITTEN isn't set on the leaf, and then the
    extended leaf checks don't get run which we rely on to validate all of
    the item pointers to make sure we don't access memory outside of the
    extent buffer.
    
    However, since 732fab95abe2 ("btrfs: check-integrity: remove
    CONFIG_BTRFS_FS_CHECK_INTEGRITY option") we no longer call
    btrfs_check_leaf() from btrfs_mark_buffer_dirty(), which means we only
    ever call it on blocks that are being written out, and thus have WRITTEN
    set, or that are being read in, which should have WRITTEN set.
    
    Add checks to make sure we have WRITTEN set appropriately, and then make
    sure __btrfs_check_leaf() always does the item checking.  This will
    protect us from file systems that have been corrupted and no longer have
    WRITTEN set on some of the blocks.
    
    This was hit on a crafted image tweaking the WRITTEN bit and reported by
    KASAN as out-of-bound access in the eb accessors. The example is a dir
    item at the end of an eb.
