    cgroup: Use open-time credentials for process migraton perm checks
    
    cgroup process migration permission checks are performed at write time as
    whether a given operation is allowed or not is dependent on the content of
    the write - the PID. This currently uses current's credentials which is a
    potential security weakness as it may allow scenarios where a less
    privileged process tricks a more privileged one into writing into a fd that
    it created.
    
    This patch makes both cgroup2 and cgroup1 process migration interfaces to
    use the credentials saved at the time of open (file->f_cred) instead of
    current's.
