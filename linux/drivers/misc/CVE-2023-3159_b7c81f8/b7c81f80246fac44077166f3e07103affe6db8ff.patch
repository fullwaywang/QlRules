    firewire: fix potential uaf in outbound_phy_packet_callback()
    
    &e->event and e point to the same address, and &e->event could
    be freed in queue_event. So there is a potential uaf issue if
    we dereference e after calling queue_event(). Fix this by adding
    a temporary variable to maintain e->client in advance, this can
    avoid the potential uaf issue.
