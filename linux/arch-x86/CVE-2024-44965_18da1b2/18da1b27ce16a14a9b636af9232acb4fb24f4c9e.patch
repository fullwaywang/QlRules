    x86/mm: Fix pti_clone_pgtable() alignment assumption
    
    [ Upstream commit 41e71dbb0e0a0fe214545fe64af031303a08524c ]
    
    Guenter reported dodgy crashes on an i386-nosmp build using GCC-11
    that had the form of endless traps until entry stack exhaust and then
    #DF from the stack guard.
    
    It turned out that pti_clone_pgtable() had alignment assumptions on
    the start address, notably it hard assumes start is PMD aligned. This
    is true on x86_64, but very much not true on i386.
    
    These assumptions can cause the end condition to malfunction, leading
    to a 'short' clone. Guess what happens when the user mapping has a
    short copy of the entry text?
    
    Use the correct increment form for addr to avoid alignment
    assumptions.
