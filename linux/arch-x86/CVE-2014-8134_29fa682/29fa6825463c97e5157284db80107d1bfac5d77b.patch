    x86, kvm: Clear paravirt_enabled on KVM guests for espfix32's benefit
    
    paravirt_enabled has the following effects:
    
     - Disables the F00F bug workaround warning.  There is no F00F bug
       workaround any more because Linux's standard IDT handling already
       works around the F00F bug, but the warning still exists.  This
       is only cosmetic, and, in any event, there is no such thing as
       KVM on a CPU with the F00F bug.
    
     - Disables 32-bit APM BIOS detection.  On a KVM paravirt system,
       there should be no APM BIOS anyway.
    
     - Disables tboot.  I think that the tboot code should check the
       CPUID hypervisor bit directly if it matters.
    
     - paravirt_enabled disables espfix32.  espfix32 should *not* be
       disabled under KVM paravirt.
    
    The last point is the purpose of this patch.  It fixes a leak of the
    high 16 bits of the kernel stack address on 32-bit KVM paravirt
    guests.  Fixes CVE-2014-8134.
