    x86: bpf_jit: fix compilation of large bpf programs
    
    x86 has variable length encoding. x86 JIT compiler is trying
    to pick the shortest encoding for given bpf instruction.
    While doing so the jump targets are changing, so JIT is doing
    multiple passes over the program. Typical program needs 3 passes.
    Some very short programs converge with 2 passes. Large programs
    may need 4 or 5. But specially crafted bpf programs may hit the
    pass limit and if the program converges on the last iteration
    the JIT compiler will be producing an image full of 'int 3' insns.
    Fix this corner case by doing final iteration over bpf program.
