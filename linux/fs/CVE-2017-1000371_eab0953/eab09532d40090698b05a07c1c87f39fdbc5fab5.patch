    binfmt_elf: use ELF_ET_DYN_BASE only for PIE
    
    The ELF_ET_DYN_BASE position was originally intended to keep loaders
    away from ET_EXEC binaries.  (For example, running "/lib/ld-linux.so.2
    /bin/cat" might cause the subsequent load of /bin/cat into where the
    loader had been loaded.)
    
    With the advent of PIE (ET_DYN binaries with an INTERP Program Header),
    ELF_ET_DYN_BASE continued to be used since the kernel was only looking
    at ET_DYN.  However, since ELF_ET_DYN_BASE is traditionally set at the
    top 1/3rd of the TASK_SIZE, a substantial portion of the address space
    is unused.
    
    For 32-bit tasks when RLIMIT_STACK is set to RLIM_INFINITY, programs are
    loaded above the mmap region.  This means they can be made to collide
    (CVE-2017-1000370) or nearly collide (CVE-2017-1000371) with
    pathological stack regions.
    
    Lowering ELF_ET_DYN_BASE solves both by moving programs below the mmap
    region in all cases, and will now additionally avoid programs falling
    back to the mmap region by enforcing MAP_FIXED for program loads (i.e.
    if it would have collided with the stack, now it will fail to load
    instead of falling back to the mmap region).
    
    To allow for a lower ELF_ET_DYN_BASE, loaders (ET_DYN without INTERP)
    are loaded into the mmap region, leaving space available for either an
    ET_EXEC binary with a fixed location or PIE being loaded into mmap by
    the loader.  Only PIE programs are loaded offset from ELF_ET_DYN_BASE,
    which means architectures can now safely lower their values without risk
    of loaders colliding with their subsequently loaded programs.
    
    For 64-bit, ELF_ET_DYN_BASE is best set to 4GB to allow runtimes to use
    the entire 32-bit address space for 32-bit pointers.
    
    Thanks to PaX Team, Daniel Micay, and Rik van Riel for inspiration and
    suggestions on how to implement this solution.
