    mac80211-hwsim: fix late beacon hrtimer handling
    
    Thomas explained in https://lore.kernel.org/r/87mtoeb4hb.ffs@tglx
    that our handling of the hrtimer here is wrong: If the timer fires
    late (e.g. due to vCPU scheduling, as reported by Dmitry/syzbot)
    then it tries to actually rearm the timer at the next deadline,
    which might be in the past already:
    
     1          2          3          N          N+1
     |          |          |   ...    |          |
    
     ^ intended to fire here (1)
                ^ next deadline here (2)
                                          ^ actually fired here
    
    The next time it fires, it's later, but will still try to schedule
    for the next deadline (now 3), etc. until it catches up with N,
    but that might take a long time, causing stalls etc.
    
    Now, all of this is simulation, so we just have to fix it, but
    note that the behaviour is wrong even per spec, since there's no
    value then in sending all those beacons unaligned - they should be
    aligned to the TBTT (1, 2, 3, ... in the picture), and if we're a
    bit (or a lot) late, then just resume at that point.
    
    Therefore, change the code to use hrtimer_forward_now() which will
    ensure that the next firing of the timer would be at N+1 (in the
    picture), i.e. the next interval point after the current time.
