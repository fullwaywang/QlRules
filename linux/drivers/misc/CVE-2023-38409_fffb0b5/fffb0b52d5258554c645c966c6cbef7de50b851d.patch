    fbcon: set_con2fb_map needs to set con2fb_map!
    
    I got really badly confused in d443d9386472 ("fbcon: move more common
    code into fb_open()") because we set the con2fb_map before the failure
    points, which didn't look good.
    
    But in trying to fix that I moved the assignment into the wrong path -
    we need to do it for _all_ vc we take over, not just the first one
    (which additionally requires the call to con2fb_acquire_newinfo).
    
    I've figured this out because of a KASAN bug report, where the
    fbcon_registered_fb and fbcon_display arrays went out of sync in
    fbcon_mode_deleted() because the con2fb_map pointed at the old
    fb_info, but the modes and everything was updated for the new one.
