    packet: in packet_do_bind, test fanout with bind_lock held
    
    Once a socket has po->fanout set, it remains a member of the group
    until it is destroyed. The prot_hook must be constant and identical
    across sockets in the group.
    
    If fanout_add races with packet_do_bind between the test of po->fanout
    and taking the lock, the bind call may make type or dev inconsistent
    with that of the fanout group.
    
    Hold po->bind_lock when testing po->fanout to avoid this race.
    
    I had to introduce artificial delay (local_bh_enable) to actually
    observe the race.
