    sctp: Do not reset the packet during sctp_packet_config().
    
    sctp_packet_config() is called when getting the packet ready
    for appending of chunks.  The function should not touch the
    current state, since it's possible to ping-pong between two
    transports when sending, and that can result packet corruption
    followed by skb overlfow crash.
