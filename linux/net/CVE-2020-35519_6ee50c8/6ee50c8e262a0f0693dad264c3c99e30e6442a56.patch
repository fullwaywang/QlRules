    net/x25: prevent a couple of overflows
    
    The .x25_addr[] address comes from the user and is not necessarily
    NUL terminated.  This leads to a couple problems.  The first problem is
    that the strlen() in x25_bind() can read beyond the end of the buffer.
    
    The second problem is more subtle and could result in memory corruption.
    The call tree is:
      x25_connect()
      --> x25_write_internal()
          --> x25_addr_aton()
    
    The .x25_addr[] buffers are copied to the "addresses" buffer from
    x25_write_internal() so it will lead to stack corruption.
    
    Verify that the strings are NUL terminated and return -EINVAL if they
    are not.
    
    Fixes: 1da177e4c3f4 ("Linux-2.6.12-rc2")
    Fixes: a9288525d2ae ("X25: Dont let x25_bind use addresses containing characters")
