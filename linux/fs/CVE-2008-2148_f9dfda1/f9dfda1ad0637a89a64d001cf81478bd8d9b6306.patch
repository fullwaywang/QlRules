    vfs: fix permission checking in sys_utimensat
    
    commit: 02c6be615f1fcd37ac5ed93a3ad6692ad8991cd9 upstream
    
    If utimensat() is called with both times set to UTIME_NOW or one of them to
    UTIME_NOW and the other to UTIME_OMIT, then it will update the file time
    without any permission checking.
    
    I don't think this can be used for anything other than a local DoS, but could
    be quite bewildering at that (e.g.  "Why was that large source tree rebuilt
    when I didn't modify anything???")
    
    This affects all kernels from 2.6.22, when the utimensat() syscall was
    introduced.
    
    Fix by doing the same permission checking as for the "times == NULL" case.
    
    Thanks to Michael Kerrisk, whose utimensat-non-conformances-and-fixes.patch in
    -mm also fixes this (and breaks other stuff), only he didn't realize the
    security implications of this bug.
