    x86/speculation: PR_SPEC_FORCE_DISABLE enforcement for indirect branches.
    
    Currently, it is possible to enable indirect branch speculation even after
    it was force-disabled using the PR_SPEC_FORCE_DISABLE option. Moreover, the
    PR_GET_SPECULATION_CTRL command gives afterwards an incorrect result
    (force-disabled when it is in fact enabled). This also is inconsistent
    vs. STIBP and the documention which cleary states that
    PR_SPEC_FORCE_DISABLE cannot be undone.
    
    Fix this by actually enforcing force-disabled indirect branch
    speculation. PR_SPEC_ENABLE called after PR_SPEC_FORCE_DISABLE now fails
    with -EPERM as described in the documentation.
