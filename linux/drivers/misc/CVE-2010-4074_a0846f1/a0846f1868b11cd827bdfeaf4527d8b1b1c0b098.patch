    USB: serial/mos*: prevent reading uninitialized stack memory
    
    The TIOCGICOUNT device ioctl in both mos7720.c and mos7840.c allows
    unprivileged users to read uninitialized stack memory, because the
    "reserved" member of the serial_icounter_struct struct declared on the
    stack is not altered or zeroed before being copied back to the user.
    This patch takes care of it.
