    icmp: randomize the global rate limiter
    
    Keyu Man reported that the ICMP rate limiter could be used
    by attackers to get useful signal. Details will be provided
    in an upcoming academic publication.
    
    Our solution is to add some noise, so that the attackers
    no longer can get help from the predictable token bucket limiter.
