    aio: fix kernel memory disclosure in io_getevents() introduced in v3.10
    
    A kernel memory disclosure was introduced in aio_read_events_ring() in v3.10
    by commit a31ad380bed817aa25f8830ad23e1a0480fef797.  The changes made to
    aio_read_events_ring() failed to correctly limit the index into
    ctx->ring_pages[], allowing an attacked to cause the subsequent kmap() of
    an arbitrary page with a copy_to_user() to copy the contents into userspace.
    This vulnerability has been assigned CVE-2014-0206.  Thanks to Mateusz and
    Petr for disclosing this issue.
    
    This patch applies to v3.12+.  A separate backport is needed for 3.10/3.11.
