    Merge v2.39.1.windows.1 (#4219)
    
    This PR takes the embargoed release tag `v2.39.1.windows.1` and merges
    it into the `main` branch.
    
    It likely that I messed something up in the order of releasing the
    security release and merging the [security
    advisory](https://github.com/git-for-windows/git/security/advisories/GHSA-v4px-mx59-w99c).
