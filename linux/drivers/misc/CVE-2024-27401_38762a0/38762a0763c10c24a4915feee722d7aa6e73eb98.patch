    firewire: nosy: ensure user_length is taken into account when fetching packet contents
    
    Ensure that packet_buffer_get respects the user_length provided. If
    the length of the head packet exceeds the user_length, packet_buffer_get
    will now return 0 to signify to the user that no data were read
    and a larger buffer size is required. Helps prevent user space overflows.
