    Clear err_code and err_reason at start of request handling
    
    req->err_code and req->err_reason are set when going to synthetic
    handling. From there the resp.reason HTTP field is set from
    req->err_reason if set, or the generic code based on req->err_code is used
    if it was NULL. This patch clears these members so that a value from the
    handling of a previous request doesn't linger.
    
    Fixes: VSV00004
